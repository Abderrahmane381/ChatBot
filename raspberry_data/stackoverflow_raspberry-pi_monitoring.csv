60543447,simulink raspberry hardware external mode error issue,"i have a problem using raspbery pi hardware and simulink, shown by the pictures below. im tring to control an led and gpio pin on the raspberry pi. i click build, deploy amp start. it works. but then i click monitor amp tune for monitoring signals. it produces an error which i cannot find a solution for. i tried different versions of matlab but got the same error. my hardware settings are just like in this link in addition i tried to click connect on external mode panel and the result is the same, the error is same. do you have any suggestions? cross posted from matlab answers.",check your matlab search path. you have the support package 2019a and 2019b on your search path. add only the one matching your matlab version.,0,matlab;raspberry-pi;monitoring;external;simulink,2020-03-05

52233421,raspberry pi 3 windows 10 iot 247 running gpio app,"im trying to create an windows 10 c uwp application for the raspberry pi 3 that runs 247. all that is done by the application is logging each interrupt of one of the gpio pins into a file. the application itself is working fine, however i cant manage to get it running on the pi 247 without getting suspended. i already added the extendedexecutionunconstrained capability to my uwp foreground app, tried converting my application to a background task app but nothing succeeded. are there any energy options on the pi that need do be adjusted to achieve this? does anyone know how to run a application 247 on windows 10 iot?",,2,uwp;raspberry-pi;monitoring;gpio;windows-10-iot-core,2018-09-08
46858256,raspberry pi home monitor,"i have been banging my head on the wall way too long on this one. i have pieced together this program and cant get it going. it is supposed to takes input from pipins.conf to select which pins are input and what the name is of the pin. it would be ex. 2 door next line 15 window and so on. i am trying to take that file and make a 2d array with the text ex. 2,door,15,window. i have also done the same for the email addresses. the program should take that information and watch the pins that are input into the file then if the pin is triggered basically pin to ground is closed and open circuit is open the program is supposed to send an email with the pin name and state of the pin with date and time only on a state change then take that same information and append it to the log.txt file. where am i going wrong here. i am very new to programming and basically need this dumb down for me to grasp at the moment. !usrbinenv python from gpiozero import button from signal import pause import time from datetime import datetime import subprocess from string import template sleeptime 0.01 notifylist with openemail.conf,r as notify for word in notify.read.split notifylist.appendword actpins with openpipins.conf,r as myfile for line in myfile lsplit line.split actpinsintlsplit0 lsplit1 def currentdate fmta dmy hms return datetime.strftimedatetime.now, fmt notifycmd pin templateecho date sensor state mail s pi sensor state email for pin in actpins def notify id, state, sensorname send each of the email addresses in notifylist a message for email in notifylist shellcmd notifycmdid.substitutedatecurrentdate, statestate, sensorsensorname, emailemail proc subprocess.popenshellcmd, shelltrue, stdoutsubprocess.pipe, stderrsubprocess.pipe stdoutvalue, stderrvalue proc.communicate with openlog.txt, a as f f.writen.formatshellcmd def doactionbutton function to send email etc will only run when opened or closed state closed if button.ispressed else opened notifybutton.pin, state, actpinsbutton.pin printstate buttons for id in actpins buttonsid buttonid buttonsid.whenpressed doaction buttonsid.whenreleased doaction printid printbuttons printactpins printnotifylist pause",,1,python-3.x;notifications;raspberry-pi;monitoring;raspbian,2017-10-20
24282500,raspberry pi connection with arduino over xrf continuous sensor monitoring,"im trying to make a system for monitoring sensor continuously including registering the time when the sensors are offline not reachable by the server. the system is based on raspberry pi as server and arduino leonardo as node with sensors and the data is communicated from arduino to raspberry via xrf. im using python script with pyserial for collecting data. my python skills are poor and i need help to figure out how to continue monitoring when the connection between arduino and raspberry is lost and when the connection is reestablished the sensor data could be collected again without restarting the script. the python script follows import serial from datetime import datetime ser serial.serialdevttyama0, 9600 while true arduino sends sensor analog reading when receiving the letter k ser.writek datetime strdatetime.now printdatetime printser.readline at the moment once the server looses connection to the client the script will stop.","i guess you need periodically reopen the connection, and also log the moments when the connection is lost? something like this... import serial import time from datetime import datetime ser serial.serialdevttyama0, 9600 while true if ser.isopentrue ser.writek arduino sends sensor analog reading when receiving the letter k datetime strdatetime.now printdatetime printser.readline time.sleep1 take a break so that you dont thrash the sensor with requests all the time else try print lost connection at s strdatetime.now ser.open except print cannot open port. exit1",1,python;raspberry-pi;monitoring;pyserial,2014-06-18
