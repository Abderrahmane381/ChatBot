raspberry automation ansible,"hi all, i have a pool automation system running at home. its basically just an esp8266 that controls relays for the pump, heater and saltwater chlorinator. i have a raspberry pi on my home network running an mqtt server and a nodered server to be able to interface with google home. i also have a cloudbased waterguru device that samples the pool chemicals once a day and sends the data to my account which in turn sends a notification to my phone. what i want to do, is to be able to intercept the data and send it directly to my pool automation system to automatically determine how long the chlorinator needs to be on for to keep the chlorine levels at the desired level. right now, i manually enter in the chlorine levels using a google home control which sends this to my pool automation system which determines how long to keep the chlorinator on for. any ideas how to do this? note, waterguru does not provide any kind of api and does not send an email with the data i need, just a notification to my phone. my first thought was using wireshark but i dont have any experience with this tool so wondering if theres a better way. appreciate any ideas. tia. || sadly, waterguru has removed gh integration || i was curious, and found this so it seems like you can connect waterguru direct to gh, from there you might be able to create a webhook or pull something out of google instead of waterguru. thats what ive done for some things in my home, send it to homekit, build the automation on hk data for nonapi gizmos. itll break down at some point, so i also create a this shit aint working automation for stuff like this. you may also be able to create a webhook that looks at waterguru, but im not sure what the dashboard looks like at all. || intercepting the data from the waterguru device can be a challenge, especially when there is no official api provided by the company. but there are a couple of methods you might want to consider. app reverse engineering it could be possible to reverse engineer the watergurus mobile app to identify the network calls it is making when it fetches your data. you could then try to mimic these calls to fetch the data directly. however, this is a complex task and could potentially violate the apps terms of service. mobile app automation notification reading android provides certain apis that can allow you to read notifications. you can create a simple application that reads the waterguru notification and then sends a request to your pool automation system. this is fairly straightforward, but it does mean you will need to maintain an android device that is always on and has the waterguru app installed. here is a broad overview on how to proceed with the second approach write a small android app which uses the notificationlistenerservice. this service allows you to intercept incoming notifications and read their contents. once you have intercepted a notification from the waterguru app, you can extract the relevant data from the notification text this would be the chemical level information. after you extract the data, you can send this to your mqtt broker. there are libraries available such as paho mqtt that allow you to publish messages to an mqtt broker from android. from there, your nodered flow can take over and adjust the chlorinator settings as required. keep in mind that these suggestions would require a fair bit of software development. its not as simple as using something like wireshark, but without a direct api from waterguru, this kind of workaround may be your best bet. also, you should consider the legal and ethical implications of these methods, as they might breach watergurus terms of service. always consult with a legal professional or seek permission from the company when in doubt."
raspberry automation ansible,"have a nice day. i am ece student and want to make iot project which i have to do for my bachelors degree thesis. there are some popular ideas on my mind like home, building automation. what are your ideas or opinions about project or projects method? i thought i can use raspberry pi 3 or stm32 with wifi addonthis one is troublesome it would be better if examples or making ways of projects are reachable and kinda realistic for student. ps arduino banned, nodemcu is not banned if its used as only wifi module, already prepared applicationsblynk, thingspeak etc are banned || bachelors degree thesis which school are you going to ?? || it depends on what part of iot you find interesting. but you seem to focus on the sensor actuator part. a lot of iot goes about power management, remote communication and machine2machine communication. also a lot of industries already use automation and machine2machine communication but they dont call it iot. also for the technology stack i would look at something more efficient than wifi. protocols like lorawan, zigbee and ble allow for more efficient communication for remote battery powered sensors. see for instance the use cases for riot os. another thing to think about is where you will send the data and what machine will handle it. be it an edge or cloud computing device. if i were you i would ask if an established industry that now is looking for more remote sensing and automation and look if they have a project for you. i think a lot of businesses see they can benefit from this technology, but they have no clue on how to move forward. because it goes so deep into the business of the company. such an project will have a big theoretical component and probably a first prototype to build they chain. but you will learn a lot from it. || example for a linuxbased device implement basic applicationlevel functionality but implement a fully secure device. from secure boot to runtime linux security. document and share your journey. open source what you end up with, your device configuration and any softwaremodule you add, documentation. this can serve as a template for other people. youll also gain a very valuable and hands on experience on security, which can get you lot of job opportunities."

raspberry automation ansible,"hello everyone, im thinking on doing this project, as my first iot project im an it student, and i was wondering if anyone has any tips or suggestion on my roadmap.so the idea is that i would like to automate the lights, but not with a smart lightbulb, i wanna do it the hard way around by putting an esp32 and a relay behind the switch on the wall.the esp32 should be always connected to the 220v with a 220 to 5v converter 1 is this possible ?, and should connect to a custom server made by me.than i would have a wall mounted tablet that i do not use, connected to the same server, and displaying a custom dashboard with data and controls. i want to make everythink by myself.the server might be hosted on a raspberry, idk yet.. i know it might be useless work but i wanna try. is this project doable ? anything i can improve ? python and mqtt intended for use. thanks! || you should look at sonoff devices as a starting point. yes, theyre a commercial product, but the most basic model is exactly the hardware youre looking for and costs 5. its an esp8266 and relay, all powered from mains. i use them all over the house to turn lamps and things on and off throughout the day, depending on the time of year, light levels, and in one case i added a pir sensor theres a programming header on the sonoff that lets you flash new firmware. everything is controlled with nodered with mqtt messages from the server. i use the tasmota firmware. but theres nothing to stop you writing your own firmware || looks doable. there are several projects like this on yt || i am scared about the part the esp32 should be always connected to the 220v with a 220 to 5v converter 1 is this possible ? what id highly recommend sort out the software side first. instead of connecting anything to 220v 230v?, use a simple led as the substitute. once your software works with that led, then replace the led with a ssr and hopefully until then you sort out the low voltage side."
raspberry automation ansible,"problem statement wanted to gather thoughtsdiscussion in the community on the idea of having one suite of opensource products which can work with each other seamlessly and be projected as one which can provide the following experiences for home automation needs for general automation security automation home camera voice assistant to control things. home robots a far fetched goal i know that the opensource solutions exist for the above needs as few i have tried general automation homeassistant, openhab etc security automation dont know of any specific, but above generalautomation can be purposed here home camera maybe hacking with new rom wyze, havent explored others voice assistant to control things mycroft etc. motivation 1. the reason for bringing this up is that there are opensource products that provide solutions for the above needs, mostly in isolation, and the usermostly with tech knowhow has to install one product then look for what else can be integrated with it. 2. the ease of using it so that a nontech person having a stab at these solutions by swapping them with actual productized solutions from companies such as ring, nest, smartthings, ghome, alexa etc is very limited. this will determine the critical mass and making it mainstream. 3. privacy of ones data and controlling it is paramount. using companies productized solutions in point 2 would most probably never guarantee privacy and user will keep struggling with the ownership. this would define the current decade. desire one software suite which includes all the above experiences where user can install it locally with just clicks imagine mainstream productized solutions and a layman user on hardware say raspberry or recommended dedicated hardware with computestorage, controlled locally. open for discussioninputs. || interesting one. i dont know of a one product which accounts for all above things. || i think point 2 is incompatible or irrelevant to your overall aim. it feels like a venn diagram with no overlap. nontech people with major privacy concerns, home automation ideas and security hardware? im not sure these people really exist"
raspberry automation ansible,"i am looking to set up some home automation, including a security system. how safe are these systems that use wifi to communicate with various sensors? i know one should use a simcard as a backup in case wifi goes down. but in terms of someone trying to intrude our wifi or the companys server got hacked? how concerned should one be? i have been looking into zigbee. as i understand it should be safer since it creates a local network and uses aes encryption. just to see if my understanding is right, would it be possible to make your own zigbee bridge with a raspberry pi, and connect various zigbee devices from phillips, samsung, etc and control them all from the single bridge? and in case wifi was down all sensors would still be able to communicate with the central hub, i would just not be able to see their status on the appwebsite? || have a look at to create your own zigbee coordinator on a raspberry pi."

raspberry automation ansible,"ive been reading a lot on iot over the last few weeks and across all the research papers ive seen, there seemed to be two recurring topics. 1. the current use cases for iot outside of iiot edge computing are a bit contrived or would be a hard sell to the cities, malls, stadiums, etc where the iot solution would be deployed. additionally, managing the costs and the latency requirements of the implementation would also be difficult. 2. there doesnt seem to be a communication standard that encompasses this experience. theres mqtt, fog computing, ngsi, etc and a few different flavors, but there isnt a de factowinning standard. this is still a new area of interest for me, so i may very well be mistaken ive got a background in web and mobile ios computing and have been playing around with arduinoraspberry pi over the last week and im struggling to come up with meaningful use case. ive built an automated irrigation system and wifi connected led projects to get my feet wet just like everyone else on instructables, but, im still at a loss on how to contribute in a more meaningful way. any suggestions on how to contribute to the iot space as in independent contributor? any intersection between iot and ios where i could contribute? || i think the best way is to get out and talk to people. let them describe their day, follow them around, and see if you can think of anything that would help them. an example a while ago i supported a thesis worker. a local university had been tracking the migration of an endangered fish. they inserted transmitters into fish and put a receiver at a strategic place in the river. the receiver logged timestamps of when each transmitter passed by. after a few weeks they pulled up the receiver and retreived the log from the sd card. he thesis worker connected the receiver to a sigfox transmitter, and transmitted the list of received ids in near real time. a small change, but this made a big difference. the professor could now get email as soon as the migration started, and they could move the receiver upstream multiple times during the migration to get additional data. i have many more examples like this, but they all start with someone working in their field a domain expert talking to someone who understands iot. the domain expert doesnt know what technical solutions exist, and the iot person doesnt know what problems exist, but together they can identify areas of improvement. || the current use cases for iot outside of iiot edge computing are a bit contrived or would be a hard sell to the cities, malls, stadiums, etc where the iot solution would be deployed. additionally, managing the costs and the latency requirements of the implementation would also be difficult. yes, when a new technology comes out, people always opine about the wonderful possibilities without regard for who will pay for that? just like people keep talking about mining resources on the moon to sell on earth. the economics are never going to work, no matter how expensive the resource. that is why every successful technology finds a killer app where someone is willing to pay a lot to solve their problem. i.e. email caused a lot of people to get online. it is rarely the use originally envisioned the web was for sharing technical documents, the telephone was for listening to concerts remotely. only by thinking deeply about the economics, can you predict what will actually be successful. saying cities, malls, stadiums, etc seems like you have been reading too much speculation. people making money in iot right now are selling to factories, homes ring, retail stores, etc. x200b there doesnt seem to be a communication standard that encompasses this experience. yup, and there never will be. even the internet isnt all http nor even all tcp. that reminds me of people complaining about all the different computer languages its not a problem, because we cant settle on one human language either. x200b playing around with arduinoraspberry pi over the last week and im struggling to come up with meaningful use case. yeah, its going to take more than a week. x200b ive built an automated irrigation system and wifi connected led projects to get my feet wet i see what you did there. x200b im still at a loss on how to contribute in a more meaningful way. any suggestions on how to contribute to the iot space as in independent contributor? you are tilting at windmills. that is like saying i just got a cs degree, how can i move the field of computing forward? sorry, but that position requires decades of research. if you want iot to be more than a hobby, youre going to have to make money at it. if you are going to make money, you have to have a customer, and have to be able to solve one of their pressing needs. its that simple. i know a guy who gets paid to put sensors on bridges and hook them up to the cloud because his customer wants early warning about floods. it all starts with the customer and their problem. || iot, although having been around for a long time 10 years, is all around you but the problem is that you only hear about the silly, contrived uses for it. that makes it sound like its a solution looking for a problem, when thats far from the truth. i led a project about 15 years ago at my company to put our very expensive machines online to enable remote diagnostics. in our case, it was very much a problem that needed to be solved, and after we did this, our service costs dropped dramatically average of 1,000day to send a service tech out. they dropped to the point that new customers had to pay higher service fees if they didnt let us put the machines on their network. i honestly dont see any unmet needs here. 15 years ago when we did that project, we had to build everything ourselves because the few providers out there were too expensive and didnt offer the flexibility we needed. today, i can stand up a simple iot monitoring solution in an afternoon if i had to! the businesses who know they need this tend to be able to find solutions because there are many providers already. i think the real problem is that there is little need for it in the consumer space and thats why it looks like a pointless toy to many. industrial and commercial iot is definitely booming but those applications tend to be hidden from view. your electric company probably doesnt need to roll a truck to get your meter readings any more because they can get them remotely, the big hvac rooftop units on top of buildings will call home to their manufacturers when they need service, the number of people enteringleaving a mall or stadium is now known in real time, etc. its big and getting bigger. however, to the end user its seen as a feature in a product, not a product in itself. i.e., when were designing a new machine or system, well get a request to add internetcellular remote monitoring or control to it. its expected as something thats built in, not an external add on."

raspberry automation ansible,"hey hackers and makers, i am not a startup founder. this is a passion project i created that i want to share with others because i hope it would help. when i first started doing iot on raspberry pis i found that all the iot frameworks out there like balena were expensive and kindof complicated. i really just wanted a simple rest api that would let me route messages to my rasberry pis without having to understand how to create secure mqtt really needed for secure communications to the thing. i was surprised that no internet gateway for hackers and makers existed for the purpose of making fun off the shelf projects. so i built x200b as a cloud architect, i had the skills to build a secure, powerful api for routing rest calls from the flashlex api to your secure mqtt message queue, and then i make its simple for the maker by creating a all of this is intended to give the power of real cloud iot to the common hacker or maker. i have a couple of projects on i would love for people to try out and build and give me feedback home automation with sonoff raspberry pi 3 iot 32x32 led matrix i think these are fun projects that can be done in a day, but i am interested in anything you think of that flashlex might let you do. i am willing to work with makers on promotional subscriptions to get valuable feedback on what we are building. developing, for one thing, is always free. if you have a bigger project let me know and if you arent making money on it i will probably try to work something out. would love your input on the project and platform! clay || "
raspberry automation ansible,"hello all, i need suggestions for encryption algorithm to be used for my iot home automation project. the aim is to automate the existing wall switches whilst keeping their current ability to switch manually intact. my system consists of a central server and multiple nodesclients. the data transfer between devices is done using sx1278 lora transceivers. im using a raspberry pi as the central server running mqtt broker and arduino pro mini for each nodeclient. a typical message sent from server to node would be in the form . now i want to encrypt this message so as to prevent the data leak i dont want people to know when im playing with my switches like a small child and also prevent the control of my switches by other wireless intruders. normal encryption aes with private key does not work because once the intruder captures a legit transmission from say server to node, heshe can just relay the same captured message over and over till he has satisfied himselfdefinitely a bad idea. example turn node 1 on message this does not change since the node and state is the same when i wish to turn on the node 1 so i need an algorithm by which i can send the same message but the encrypted cipher will change every time i transmit it. im aware of the kind of encryption used in car keys that use a synced pseudo random number generator on both sides. but im skeptical of its feasibility on arduino. any suggestions would be great. || you are describing a replay attack. you can protect against these without changing your key every message, e.g. by using a counter. i believe this is what lorawan does. if youre not using lorawan or some other secure protocol, you will need to do a lot of homework. security is very easy to do wrong. but if its just a home project i say go for it. the best way to learn is to lose sleep over it! || dumb question, but wouldnt just using tls over this mqtt channel solve this problem?"
raspberry automation ansible,"so here is the point create a standardization of the way we program connected objects so we can use modelchecking algorithm to make sure they behave as expected. with this, everyone will be able to create its own connected object using chips or smartphones or simply a raspberry pi. so you do not need to buy a complete device from a private company but just build it yourself, since you can simply use opensource code. next is using a blockchain, allow these connected objects to communicate together to share informations in order to improve their behavior. they make transactions to upload and download operational data from the blockchain they can either just make transactions like ok this is the way i work using a given set of parameters, and my electricity consumption is x. or they can be a node and then verify both a transaction and run a light modelchecking tool verifying the parameters given in the transaction. given a set of parameters in a transaction, the tool outputs either yes, i can use the same set of parameters and my behavior is not compromised or no, with this new set of parameters there might be a bug. this already exists. moreover it is the job of other connected objects to ensure your own object behaves well. so you pay fees to other connected objects because they helped you. such a network could make some money saving for people using it. currently with for instance connected radiators that optimize their behavior according to the presence or not of someone at home one can make a 30 electricity bill saving. with such a collaborative tool to exchange secure informations in the sense that it brings no bug we could develop so much green processes without the need of any google, amazon or any big brother company. using again the blockchain we could sell informations to energy companies that need so much to know about our behaviors. more than that, and imho i believe it is an active field of research, we can automate communication between different type of connected objects so they work for a common purpose, like the wellbeing of the human owner. with those shared data we can ensure the well behavior of connected objects that are connected in the same home or building. sooo what do you think ? is it interesting or completely infeasible using a blockchain or useless ? disclaimer i am a modelchecking phd student. || its not that its impossible its that for every standard you try to create you just create more ways to do it. relevant xkcd on the subject. || create a standardization of the way we program connected objects there is no way you can standardize that because the hardware properties between these objects are vastly different. some have an operating system like linux, others use a rtos, or bare bones. never mind the different communication interfaces... next is using a blockchain, allow these connected objects to communicate together wont work since some devices communicate over lora, others over bt, or cellular, or... some of these are so resource constraint both on bandwidth as well as processing power and power requirements you wont have the ability to do blockchain operations. you can do this for a very particular subset of iot, but not for iot as a whole. the one thing you should remember at all times is that iot is mainly a marketing term someone thought it would be a good idea to group a vast variety of embedded problems with their highly specific requirements and solutions under one term internet of things. now we are at the point where people try to unify all those diverse problems under a single solution this wont work just like you cant have just one means of transport for every single logistical problem. || i think that synching with a blockchain is too much for an light iot device in terms of network usage, cpu and memory usage, so for a lot of use cases it will need access to a trusted peer. maybe provided by the manufacturer, maybe that you can run yourself on your internet box... regarding semantic and development standards, we are still far from it something like onem2m or lwm2mipso is still far away from being used outside if pocs, and device manufacturers are pushing their own cloudsmodels... interoperability will take years until it becomes an expected feat. well have to wait for a satisfacting proposal, open, and promoted by a major manufacturer and service provider google? apple?. this may appear on specialised business domains smart building, smart metering, asset tracking... but unifying everything is still a dream to me."
