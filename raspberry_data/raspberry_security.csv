raspberry security,"hey there, my friend needs assistance setting up iot devices at home without compromising the security of his personal devices. these devices should solely access the internet for firmware updates and essential services. with a spare raspberry pi and a tablet at our disposal, were unsure where to begin. could you offer guidance on the hardware, software, and configurations needed? were aiming for opensource solutions to minimize expenses. any recommendations or helpful youtube tutorials would be welcomed. thanks in advance for your help! || have you looked at home assistant? is another option if you want something."
raspberry security,"hey everyone, im a computer science student working on my first iot project. the device will be based on a raspberry pi and i was wondering what measures are typically taken to secure such devices. im especially worried about not running security updates. my current ideas were router level no port forwarding raspberry pi firewall, close all ports does a readonly file system improve security? does a vpn help? the device will communicate with a server which has to be exposed to the public internet. what of these ideas make sense? what do you usually do? any pointers are helpful! || a couple tools to investigate keylime network bound disk encryption fdo, fido || id recommend creating a threat model document that outlines threats youd expect, the risk if acted upon and plans to mitigate them. at a high level, you have multiple threats, depending on your operating environment are a bigger or smaller deal. common threats man in the middle attacks exposed ports services can be attacked on the same network or externally depending on environment vulnerabilities in software vulnerabilities in hardware physical tampering vulnerabilities || the biggest thing is to block incoming network requests and initiate all connections from the router. something like helps a lot as they have solved many of the security problems, yet allow you to push information to edge devices without having open ports."

raspberry security,"google kills cloud iot core a fully managed service for securely connecting and managing devices, at the google io conference in may 2017. in september of that year, the solution to all users in beta. fell short of its ambition to make enterprise iot app development easy. this month, google decided to kill the project. google cloud iot core is being retired on august 16, 2023. contact your google cloud account team for more information, reads the only on google clouds web page. according to a hackernews the google cloud iot core product team shared an email to existing users, clarifying their access to the iot core device manager apis will no longer be available after august 16, 2023. as of that date, devices will be unable to connect to the google cloud iot core mqtt and http bridges, and google cloud will shut down existing connections. google hasnt been shy about retiring products from the iot landscape. in 2015, an iot os allegedly capable of running on 32mb ram at google io. after the following year, promising three years of updates for every device. in 2019, giving up on its vision as a generalpurpose os for iot devices. a couple of years later, they first stopped supporting new projects in 2021 and later turned it down for all projects in 2022. google cloud iot core is just the latest joiner of the infamous list. what options are left for google cloud iot core users? privacy concerns over amazons acquisition of irobot is known for introducing the roomba, one of the bestselling robot vacuums on amazon, in 2002. last month, amazon and irobot under which amazon will acquire the makers of the roomba vacuum. a team of mit roboticists cofounded irobot in 1990 and unveiled their first product, a robot designed for space exploration, a year later. after pivoting toward detecting and eliminating mines in surf zones with irobot to build a tactical mobile robot in 1998. the contract led to the development of the and its in september 2001. irobot reached productmarket fit with the floor vacuuming robot in 2002. since then, irobot bolstered its product lines with a series of launches, including the for floor washing, the for shop sweeping and the pool cleaning robot. to this day, the awardwinning roomba series of vacuum cleaning robots remains their most profitable achievement. with the latest acquisition, amazon keeps expanding its home technology portfolio after and texttospeech key for developing what raised regarding collecting and processing personal information for the millions of worldwide roomba users. in response, colin angle, irobots ceo and one of the mit technologists who founded the company more than two decades ago, emphasised protecting customer data and privacy is of the utmost importance for irobot. in the ceo reassured its customers that irobot does not and will not sell their personal information. ubuntu runs outofthebox on riscv boards in the past decade, opensource software and open standards have reshaped the world of technology and produced longlasting results. the time is now ripe for open hardware to meet open software. is a new paradigm for open source hardware, developing a the isa holds the promise of increasingly rapid processor innovation through open standard collaboration. thanks to its availability on a wide range of processors, from lowend microcontrollers to highend servergrade processors, riscv is poised to empower a new era of processor innovation with rapid industrywide adoption. combining the best opensource architecture with the best opensource operating system, porting further facilitates the adoption of novel computing architectures. as part of a vibrant ecosystem driving innovation at the edge, canonical and its iot technology partners work together to promote the deployment of highperformance devices. within a few days, ubuntu on and as ubuntu and opensource software are already accelerating the adoption of iot innovations, support for the riscv isa reflects canonicals commitment to continued investments in open standards and collaboration. visionfive 2 a riscv alternative to the pi? another great release will please those wishing to see the rise of alongside x86 and arm. just a few days after it enabled ubuntu on the visionfive board, computer sbc. made significant strides to feature a wide range of interfaces with powerful performance. the visionfive 2 is a pioneering board that combines performance with a lowcost, opensource riscv sbc. the board is significantly more powerful than its previous iteration, with more than double the performance per watt. the visionfive 2 boasts a quadcore cpu running at 1.5 ghz, up from 1.0 ghz in the jh7100. compared to the original it further integrates the supporting opengl, opencl and vulkan. the latest sbc by starfive drops onboard wifi and bluetooth in favour of an m.2 mkey expansion module. also, the newest version of the visionfive series adds a 4lane mipi dsi display port that supports up to 2k at 30fps, whereas the hdmi port now supports 4k up to 30fps. priced at 55 for its 2gb model and 85 for the 8gb model, the visionfive 2 is a great entry into the riscv computing ecosystem. riscv isnt at raspberry pi prices yet, but its now at parity with nonpi arm boards. by releasing its second generation of the first costeffective linuxbased riscv sbc, starfive will help usher in a new era of opensource hardware and software computing. the company also launched a fund the boards production. bosch to build digital twin of manufacturing plant bosch aims to create a digital twin of the machinery and process flow at one of its plants in madrid. to accelerate the digitisation of its industrial facilities and work on the simulation, bosch is partnering with open collaboration to further industrial automation is not new. just last month, their joint work on advancing digital twins for manufacturing. by connecting the and the ecosystem, the two companies aim to expand the use of digital twin technologies to bring a new level of speed and efficiency to solve design, production and operational challenges. the partnership will help manufacturers respond to customer demands, reduce downtime and adapt to supply chain uncertainties while achieving sustainability and production targets. the announcement is interesting because multiverse computing will work with bosch on creating a for madrids manufacturing facility. works on developing quantuminspired algorithms deployed on supercomputers and quantum hardware. bosch aims to enhance quality control and production efficiencies by bringing quantum computing into madrids manufacturing facility. whereas the industrial pioneers current digitisation efforts in 240 plants resulted in 120,000 connected machines and more than 250,000 devices, it remains to be seen whether quantum technologies are mature enough to bring substantive benefits to industrial computing. || "
raspberry security,"hey there! let me share with you my new project that i posted on hackster.io ill provide a link to the full stepbystep guide in the comments below. lately, ive been immersed in various tinyml projects, which involve creating super tiny machine learning models and running them on small devices without turning to the cloud. this approach gives a number of advantages, such as internet independence no waste of energy and money on data transfer advanced privacy and security ability to make cheap aidriven devices in this project, i implemented the ability to predict the damage in a gearbox based on data from 4 vibration sensors by using a tinyml model embedded into a simple 4 mcu raspberry pi pico. to train the model, i used a dataset from kaggle see link in the comments. i trained the model automatically using a freetouse platform, i transfer data for predictions via a usb to the microcontroller. you can check the metrics of the model accuracy and size in the table below please feel free to leave your comments especially if you repeat the experiment yourself. || to see how i got such outcomes, check out my full stepbystep guide on hackster the dataset you could find via the link thank you for your attention! || this is awesome. edge ai is real most use cases reside imho. ive currently immersed myself in edge ai, specifically creating models for autonomous drone delivery. it seems to be a pretty tough problem condensing the compute requirements into a pico unit at cheap prices."
raspberry security,"i am currently developing my first iot solution as part of my bachelors degree in mechatronics. the task is pretty simple i get my data from an existing machine via for the cloud infrastructure, we are working with i am using a as my edge device basically an industrialgrade pi and plan to use the for added safety and easy deployments of containers from the cloud. there is just one problem. how do i handle data safely while it is on my device so a potential malicious actor cannot tamper with it? i know microsoft offers a to be used with their iot edge runtime but it costs this seems a bit excessive to me. what other solutions are there? or do you recommend just biting the bullet and coughing up the money? one thing to note is that my data is sensitive and will eventually be used for billing purposes so it has to be a fairly safe affair. thank you in advance || if youre running on linux you may be able to take advantage of ecryptfs which will encrypt disk storage on the pi || i realize this is a university project and im not sure i understand your architecture well enough, so take the following with appropriate grain of salt. i do infosec and i think its wise to consider all the threats in the system holistically and apply security controls to address the attack vectors corresponding to the threats. so... assuming you have an edge rpi data coming into it from modbus rtu thing, and it is sending andor receiving data from some cloud back end, as below... modbus rtu pi cloud backend then the relevant threats to consider are... network based attack against networkenabled daemons, physical theft leading to data loss physical access leading to tampering with system or data, malicious data input from cloud, network, or user data theft via spoofing backend destination backend attack via spoofing edge rpi. spoof modbus rtu and send malicious input in short, harden rpi, perform input validation everywhere, limit physical access. follow hardening guides for the pi if it connected to a network. basically, use host firewall to block all but the necessary ports. uninstall unneeded software doing this without breaking something is time consuming and not strictly necessary with firewall. ensure whatever networkaccessible listening software remains hopefully only just ntp and ssh is configured in a secure manner. in a real production environment youd want some kind of mechanism andor process for keeping the edge os patched. just in case. physical theft of the sd card or of the powered off device is thwarted by full disk encryption or at least sensitive data encryption. in addition, some sort of tamper proof enclosure adds mitigation for this threat as well as for tampering. if it is battery powered, lock the enclosure to something. otherwise, as with a laptop, it may be possible to read the decrypted data if the bad guy can hack into the box for backend spoofing, you probably want the rpi to authenticate the server, perhaps using and signed certificates signed costs so unsigned as a proof of concept, only, is fine. finally spoofing the edge device, client certificate in other words, tls mutual authentication is one option. of course key management is important how do you provision, update, revoke certs on all these edge devices in a way that isnt a nightmare to manage? a simple username password is another way. likewise on the backend be sure to do proper input validation in case other safeguards fail and bad guys send malicious input to the backend. and input validation on the modbus rtu input serial, yes? including data, protocol, whatever else. could a bad guy connect a terminal and do ctrlc or something else? hope this helps"
raspberry security,"hey all, so i am wanting to do my first iot project. goal 247 web server running on a micro controllermicroprocessor. when it receives a request that contains a uniqueperuser identifier. log the identifier received to a file. send a wol message to the main server to boot. my use case i have a plex media server and a large number of notsotechsavy siblings. keeping the server on 247, even idling, draws a decent amount of power that id like to cheapen. so the solution is to turn it off when it is not in use, but i want the ability for anyone to turn it on when theyd like. getting this to work insecurely is very easy, just open the right ports and share the magic packet with everyone. but i want something that is more secure. so what i need is a small device that can remain on 247 that draws as little power as possible. it would act as a web server, so that any of my users can login with their unique details to turn on the server. i have a good understanding of the software, network, security etc. but i am not not sure of the hardware. i am currently looking at raspberry pi but even that looks overkill for what i want. || does not get much smaller than this for arduino use esp8266 only if you happen to have some flying around. esp32 is so much better. use micropython or espruino or arduino. since arduino can do it, so can the other ones. || if you are still interested to achieve this using esp controller x200b i have opensource project that meet your requirements however, it is complex to setup and i dont maintain it anymore. esp32 connect to mqtt from aws iot pwa userinterface and as urustyswashplate stated, you could use the library but you will need to write esp8266esp32 firmware and either create webserver if you can do portforwarding or use services for iot i.e. better approach that i see havent tested it though is they support multiple plugins, and one of them is my wakeonlan library"
raspberry security,"i have a home security system that consists of a raspberry pi, a verizon mifi, and several other devices that are all receiving their power via usb. i want to get a ups but they all seem to feature six or eight 110v outlets and only one or two usb outlets. i would like to find a ups that reverses those numbers six or eight usb outlets and only one or two 110v outlets. some way for the pi to know when the main power has gone out with also be useful. any suggestions? thanks! || pijuice hat from pisupply. || not sure where you are from, but i have both one of these and so far i am very happy with it. || some way for the pi to know when the main power has gone out with also be useful. any suggestions? you can post the boot counter to some backend. when it reports a lower number, you know the device was rebooted."
raspberry security,"problem statement wanted to gather thoughtsdiscussion in the community on the idea of having one suite of opensource products which can work with each other seamlessly and be projected as one which can provide the following experiences for home automation needs for general automation security automation home camera voice assistant to control things. home robots a far fetched goal i know that the opensource solutions exist for the above needs as few i have tried general automation homeassistant, openhab etc security automation dont know of any specific, but above generalautomation can be purposed here home camera maybe hacking with new rom wyze, havent explored others voice assistant to control things mycroft etc. motivation 1. the reason for bringing this up is that there are opensource products that provide solutions for the above needs, mostly in isolation, and the usermostly with tech knowhow has to install one product then look for what else can be integrated with it. 2. the ease of using it so that a nontech person having a stab at these solutions by swapping them with actual productized solutions from companies such as ring, nest, smartthings, ghome, alexa etc is very limited. this will determine the critical mass and making it mainstream. 3. privacy of ones data and controlling it is paramount. using companies productized solutions in point 2 would most probably never guarantee privacy and user will keep struggling with the ownership. this would define the current decade. desire one software suite which includes all the above experiences where user can install it locally with just clicks imagine mainstream productized solutions and a layman user on hardware say raspberry or recommended dedicated hardware with computestorage, controlled locally. open for discussioninputs. || interesting one. i dont know of a one product which accounts for all above things. || i think point 2 is incompatible or irrelevant to your overall aim. it feels like a venn diagram with no overlap. nontech people with major privacy concerns, home automation ideas and security hardware? im not sure these people really exist"
raspberry security,"i am looking to set up some home automation, including a security system. how safe are these systems that use wifi to communicate with various sensors? i know one should use a simcard as a backup in case wifi goes down. but in terms of someone trying to intrude our wifi or the companys server got hacked? how concerned should one be? i have been looking into zigbee. as i understand it should be safer since it creates a local network and uses aes encryption. just to see if my understanding is right, would it be possible to make your own zigbee bridge with a raspberry pi, and connect various zigbee devices from phillips, samsung, etc and control them all from the single bridge? and in case wifi was down all sensors would still be able to communicate with the central hub, i would just not be able to see their status on the appwebsite? || have a look at to create your own zigbee coordinator on a raspberry pi."
raspberry security,"i have posted before for help,but now i want to be more specific explaining the project and in what i need help for. the project will be a development of an opensource voice assistant like amazon echo,google home.we would like to list the available voice assistants in the market,how they are working,what security gaps can be exposed. after we will explain why we choose a cloudfree option,why is better in terms of security and privacy and how we achieve it we will use an opensource voice assistant like mycroft,jarvis etc that can be embedded in a raspberry pi,connecting a microphone and a speaker to the raspberry the user can use voice commands to control iot devices that will be connected to the microprocessor. the iot devices will be connected to a tasmotta server using mqtt to communicate with the user and we will create differents senarioslike onoff lamp,schedule lamp to close or change brightness,openclose thermostat with sonoff,etc. who do you think is the best opensource voice assistant that dont have a cloud service or dont pair to company a server? how i can start embedding the voice assistant to the raspberry pi? || hi, maybe this can help you i would use nodered for all the logic in the pi for design an event driven architecture."
raspberry security,"in this video we will install nextcloud on a raspberry pi 4 so we can upload our files from mobile and desktop devices just like google drive, onedrive, dropbox and others, but directly to our homes with a lot more privacy. in a times where pretty much every big company tracks you down from everywhere and it is almost impossible to escape them if you are using internet. nextcloud and a local computer is kind of fresh air of personal privacy. wait a minute here, you may ask what is nextcloud? nextcloud is an opensource project that you can install on your local device. it allows you to control and upload documents, pictures, and everything you wish on your own personal computer at home. and not on the google, microsoft or amazon cloud. to successfully implement this you will need a raspberry pi where raspberry pi 4 is recommended with installed raspberryos and secure shell access to it. you will also need a public static ip contact your internet service provider for that of course you will need some kind of storage the more the better. if you want to store your pictures and videos you will need a lot, but if you want to save only important documents several gigabytes will be enough. for the demo i will use a sd card for the raspberryos and a usb flash drive for the nextcloud storage. it is recommended to use ssd drives if you have some around. now lets install nextcloud on a raspberry pi to see what will happen the video if you prefer to read, this is the full article and web story specially optimised for mobile devices insta like cheers, kiril || i would usually remove posts like this as they are promoting your own channelblog, but youve made some attempt to explain the benefits, etc. ill leave it up if you stick around to answer questions from the community, otherwise its just a postandforget self promotion. || i tried this a few years ago on a pi3b and a externalharddrive no ssd the performance was bad. so how is the performance now?"
raspberry security,"hi all x200b im kinda new to networking and all thatim a sys admin and i want as a personal project to use a temp sensor on a raspberry and send the info using lora to a gateway then to a server using lorawan. im kinda lost in what to use to start it. i have checked and i cant make up my mind what to buy. ive seen microcontrollers that use circuitpython and i want to use python because thats the language i know the most but i cannot find if i can install a temp sensor as example a feather m0 rfm9x and send the info using lora. there are raspberries and that i can attach a temp sensor, a weather sensor , gps and all that, a battery too , and a lorawan hat . but im lost in which one to usebuy. also i was checking blockchain to secure the transactions, but i dont think i can use it on microcontrollers. also i wanted to add encryption using a python library , but will the microcontroller be able to handle it? hope anyone can direct me on this and cheers to all! || hi! i started my iot journey a few years ago and my first advice would be to make your projects more ambitious incrementally. a raspberry pi is a perfect place to start, i would consider a raspberry pi 4 so you can have wired internet, wifi and bluetooth, in addition to great support for all the hats and sensors you can connect to the gpios. i would start with a temperature sensor like a dht11dht22, there are tons of tutorials connecting them and sending the data somewhere. you could start by sending that data somewhere i like azure iot central, but im megabiased through a wired connection or wifi. next you can implement lora, again lots of info online, but try not to tackle both issues at the same time would be my advice! as for blockchain iot, there are a few papers on the subject and why iot might benefit from it. i work in a team where we have experts in both fields and we are currently not convinced of the benefits. if you have a strong working knowledge of blockchain and how to interact and write smart contracts for instance for it, knock yourself out after you get the data out using any connection method. also, a microcontroller can handle some basic encryption depending on the specs, a raspberry pi a mini computer, not a microcontroller is definitely capable of handling it. || depending how important lorawan is to you, i could also help you get started with the platform me and my colleagues are building but we use zigbee ... just let me know, im happy to help. || if you have access to wifi network, all you need is a cheap esp8266, dht22 sensor, aws account and this micropython repo"
raspberry security,"hi, im trying to find papers that will give me an insight into iot and smart homes for their security, how they work, as well as how traffic flows within these devices and technologies. any research that you know of on these would be great. i have 2 networks i have built 1 with a remote connection through a smart phone and the other indirect control through a switch and sbc board. looking into hive app and webcam control for the remote connection. microbits and raspberry pi for the direct access if you have any research from websites etc this would be amazing. thanks for any help. || you arent going to find a lot of these that exist at the moment, its still a relativly new field when all is said and done. this of course depends on what you are actually asking about i guess, so ill only discuss general iot information and not specifics of hive or anything. and it was given less than 2 years ago. i know there is currently more research in this type of attack vector. when discussing specific iot security, a lot of people are putting faith in the seperation their router provides, but if you send any of that traffic to the internet that vector technically exists. another concern is a device being brought into your house insdie the firewall, which could attack devices. here are two additional resources related to it, including a pdf on common attack vectors and some examples. || ive worked on this topic during my master thesis about 1 year ago and i had a hard time to actually find specific papers. if you want to learn about techniques how to test the security of iot devices, you should have a look at there also a lot of talks about hacking the iot. actual information about how vendors implement security protocols is not available. ive figured out that vendors like to use their own security implementation. there are a few projects aiming to develop a standard like and but as far as i know, they are not accepted as the standard. why do you need this information? what are you planning to do? do you want to implement your own private secure connection? is it for a company? any background information would be appreciated."
raspberry security,"is it possible to emulate an iot device as a virtual machine? im currently writing a security audit tool for iot devices but i need to be able to emulate a lan with iot devices in. these dont need to function, but they do need to emulate that the service is running and the ports are open. i, unfortunately, cannot connect them to my home network due to being in an apartment building that uses its own isp and as such we dont have access to the router and any device on the network cannot speak to other devices. i am open to purchasing an access point for my desktop and allowing smart devicesraspberry pis to connect that way, if thats a possibility. open to suggestions, thanks! || in order to emulate iot devices and specific network configuration i typically use cloud infrastructure. i use ec2 instances as iot devices and vpc to create network subnets with restrictions that you have in real setup i. e. firewalls, routing etc. this way i can emulate bigger iot devices, for smaller devices i usually use software emulators. || i have an old dir655 wireless router that i hooked up just for my iot sensor network in my apartment building. i mostly did it because wifi is saturated and i needed wireless in my tinker shed. i just dont use the wan port on the router, or use it for actual routing its strictly an ap and switch at this point. || we write a small python script for example speed of a car gps and then publish to the mqtt broker.. repeat ad nauseam. project was a dashboard development with hundreds of simultaneous sensors and too lazy to solder up hundreds of sensors"
raspberry security,"hey hackers and makers, i am not a startup founder. this is a passion project i created that i want to share with others because i hope it would help. when i first started doing iot on raspberry pis i found that all the iot frameworks out there like balena were expensive and kindof complicated. i really just wanted a simple rest api that would let me route messages to my rasberry pis without having to understand how to create secure mqtt really needed for secure communications to the thing. i was surprised that no internet gateway for hackers and makers existed for the purpose of making fun off the shelf projects. so i built x200b as a cloud architect, i had the skills to build a secure, powerful api for routing rest calls from the flashlex api to your secure mqtt message queue, and then i make its simple for the maker by creating a all of this is intended to give the power of real cloud iot to the common hacker or maker. i have a couple of projects on i would love for people to try out and build and give me feedback home automation with sonoff raspberry pi 3 iot 32x32 led matrix i think these are fun projects that can be done in a day, but i am interested in anything you think of that flashlex might let you do. i am willing to work with makers on promotional subscriptions to get valuable feedback on what we are building. developing, for one thing, is always free. if you have a bigger project let me know and if you arent making money on it i will probably try to work something out. would love your input on the project and platform! clay || "
raspberry security,"so here is the point create a standardization of the way we program connected objects so we can use modelchecking algorithm to make sure they behave as expected. with this, everyone will be able to create its own connected object using chips or smartphones or simply a raspberry pi. so you do not need to buy a complete device from a private company but just build it yourself, since you can simply use opensource code. next is using a blockchain, allow these connected objects to communicate together to share informations in order to improve their behavior. they make transactions to upload and download operational data from the blockchain they can either just make transactions like ok this is the way i work using a given set of parameters, and my electricity consumption is x. or they can be a node and then verify both a transaction and run a light modelchecking tool verifying the parameters given in the transaction. given a set of parameters in a transaction, the tool outputs either yes, i can use the same set of parameters and my behavior is not compromised or no, with this new set of parameters there might be a bug. this already exists. moreover it is the job of other connected objects to ensure your own object behaves well. so you pay fees to other connected objects because they helped you. such a network could make some money saving for people using it. currently with for instance connected radiators that optimize their behavior according to the presence or not of someone at home one can make a 30 electricity bill saving. with such a collaborative tool to exchange secure informations in the sense that it brings no bug we could develop so much green processes without the need of any google, amazon or any big brother company. using again the blockchain we could sell informations to energy companies that need so much to know about our behaviors. more than that, and imho i believe it is an active field of research, we can automate communication between different type of connected objects so they work for a common purpose, like the wellbeing of the human owner. with those shared data we can ensure the well behavior of connected objects that are connected in the same home or building. sooo what do you think ? is it interesting or completely infeasible using a blockchain or useless ? disclaimer i am a modelchecking phd student. || its not that its impossible its that for every standard you try to create you just create more ways to do it. relevant xkcd on the subject. || create a standardization of the way we program connected objects there is no way you can standardize that because the hardware properties between these objects are vastly different. some have an operating system like linux, others use a rtos, or bare bones. never mind the different communication interfaces... next is using a blockchain, allow these connected objects to communicate together wont work since some devices communicate over lora, others over bt, or cellular, or... some of these are so resource constraint both on bandwidth as well as processing power and power requirements you wont have the ability to do blockchain operations. you can do this for a very particular subset of iot, but not for iot as a whole. the one thing you should remember at all times is that iot is mainly a marketing term someone thought it would be a good idea to group a vast variety of embedded problems with their highly specific requirements and solutions under one term internet of things. now we are at the point where people try to unify all those diverse problems under a single solution this wont work just like you cant have just one means of transport for every single logistical problem. || i think that synching with a blockchain is too much for an light iot device in terms of network usage, cpu and memory usage, so for a lot of use cases it will need access to a trusted peer. maybe provided by the manufacturer, maybe that you can run yourself on your internet box... regarding semantic and development standards, we are still far from it something like onem2m or lwm2mipso is still far away from being used outside if pocs, and device manufacturers are pushing their own cloudsmodels... interoperability will take years until it becomes an expected feat. well have to wait for a satisfacting proposal, open, and promoted by a major manufacturer and service provider google? apple?. this may appear on specialised business domains smart building, smart metering, asset tracking... but unifying everything is still a dream to me."
raspberry security,"hello, i have recently installed a router within my dorm room. i am aware of the risks this implies however, the building supervisor essentially told us at the beginning of the year that that is okay as long as we are only using it for ourselves. currently, i have my router plugged into an ethernet jack and acting as an access point which 1 is wpa2 protected and 2 does not broadcast ssid i know this doesnt really improve security, just thought id mention it. on top of this, the router is connected to my desktop pc. i also recently acquired a chromecast, vizio soundbar not smart, and a wireless printer. the chromecast and printer depend on this network to operate i am now able to cast from any device desktop, laptop, phone to my tv as long as both devices are connected to router. on top of this, i can print from any device. while i am incredibly satisfied with where i am, i still feel there are more improvements to be made. i do not want to invest too much money into whatever projects, but i have plenty of time to dig in to. some examples of projects i would want to pursue are raspberry pi mounted on door with a servo which would open my door from my smart phone iot lighting around room are there any other ideas you can think of which are fairly lowcost and achievable within a dorm setting? thanks. || study. || integrating lighing rpi and soundbar for musiclight color changing. || you probably dont need an rpi for the door lock, you can use an arduino or esp8266 or something similar, will save you some money. maybe integrate wake on lan to that? though then you probably do need an rpi. smart coffee maker? and by smart i mean something simple like esp8266 relay on the wall socket. of course then you could put openvpn on rpi and ssh into your own home and put the coffee maker on when you please!"
raspberry security,"i recently purchased my first arduino board and thought i was buying a wifi adaptor esp12e lmao oops for it, but ended up with two different devices. im fairly new to all of this, so i apologize if i misuse terms! ive been messing with the nodemcu 1.0 and have recently thought of the idea to use it for a smartcontrol for the light switch in my room with a servo motor. i have tested connecting to the device through a web browser and sending it requests and also set up an iphone. my concern is that obviously its not secure to simply go to an ip address in a browser and then fire off a request haha. im in a housing complex where i guarantee many people would screw with me if they knew about this. therefore, im wondering what the safestbest security measure is to achieve this. i was thinking about possibly requiring a password to be able to achieve an action, but still that does not seem secure. is there anyway to make it deviceunique, where my phone is the only device that can control it? also, id like to be able to accesscontrol the board from anywhere not just my lan. what are the proper steps in achieving this? i have a raspberry pi sitting around that i could maybe try to host a web server on? i appreciate any feedbacktips, thank you! || hello, i would recommend looking into blynk. they have authentication for every phone and device, you can use the pi as a server host."
raspberry security,"the internet of things buzzword is getting more traction and software companies device manufactures are in a land rush to get something to market. as a result, ive been seeing a lot of frameworks like and pop up that provide a way for you to get sensor data from your embedded device to their proprietary cloud and then apis to play with the data. i have two main disconnects with all of this 1. with iot platforms like these in general, the main selling point is that you can get sensor data from all over the world and use that for your application. besides weather and environment apps that can monitor temperature, humidity, air quality, and so on, what kind of utility would that have? in other words, what kind of useful applications could come out of having a light intensity sensor, accelerometer, proximity sensor, or any other generalpurpose sensing device connected to the internet for all to analyze? 2. since everyone has their own cloud platform for managing data, it seems like its pretty unsustainable. had a piece about this and brought up the need for ieee iot standards. still, even if a standard comes about for communication between embedded devices and servers, companies will still want to have their own clouds and data services. its a similar problem to trying to communicate with people who primarily use google hangouts, facebook messenger, or whats app for their human communication needs, since nothing integrates with anything else and cant easily be brought under singular service. where is the endgame here? anyone have any thoughts on this? || ieee, w3c, and ietf are all actively working on standards at various levels... ieee at low level networking, ietf at the protocol and data interchange, and w3c at the data content levels. if the various cloud infrastructures adopt these standards it becomes easy to integrate between one or more of them. most of these clouds though arent really for everyday users. look at xively, they are being used by a manufacturer of freezers for labs, xively provides the infrastructure to power all the data for all the freezers, but any lab manager only cares about and sees their own freezers. which may be in multiple locations. || ive always had the same feeling about the use of iot. i guess my answer is i dont really know what future utility these data streams provide, but i do look forward to the innovations that could come from it. i think that what zymbit city brings to the table is a potential showcase of these innovative projects, and the availability of subscribing to others data and leveraging those data streams for your own application. i remember seeing a project that used a microphone to detect gunshots, and then triangulating the position of the gunshot using multiple microphones. it really opened my eyes to how cool ideas are out there and can benefit from the iot. what if an entire community used raspberry pis to upload those audio streams? i think the potential applications are endless, but i too havent wrapped my head around the possible utilities of iot aside from weather tracking. as for standardization, i believe the hackaday article pointed out something is coming in 2017. my guess is as iot becomes less of a buzzword and more of a reality, then standardization is imminent. after a few years, cloud services will probably boil down to a few large competitors, similar to the big players like apple and google of today. || check this out as uexfederalie says, the internet of things is a description of a reality always keep that in mind. it is not a thing in it self. its a certain time in history. i think this is a good way to remind yourself that devices in the age of iot are not supposed to be categorized together. distinct problems will call for distinct solutions, and simply thinking that throwing some iot at a problem will help solve it will get you nowhere. i think the greatest benefits of this revolution as some people call it are dependent on global commitment to securitystandards. with stuff such as apple watch, nest, amazon echo etc. coming out, there will be a abundance of data relating to language, health and so forth that could really help us solve some cultural and societal problems. privacy and datasecurity is obviously two ethical areas that must be discussed thoroughly before any globaldatacollectioneffort can be set up."
