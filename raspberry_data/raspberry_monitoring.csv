raspberry monitoring,"basically, im wondering if the above exists? im a bit unfamiliar with some of the technology and jargon, so hoping to get some help here can steer me in the right direction. someone recommend me to monnits iot sensors, which sounded promising, but it appears they still need an iot gateway, which appear cant tell for sure to either a not have that long of battery life or b require constant power. im open to getting creative and learning about raspberry pis, etc., if thats whats required, but itd be great if not! in case it helps, use case is to monitor a remote, passively cooled cellar. thanks in advance! || lorabased sensor is more helpfull, no need wifi or inerent, and are low battry operated, || so, battery powered sensors exist for sure. but, if you dont want to use wifi, how are you planning on getting the data from the sensor wirelessly? bluetooth? zigbee? lorawan? lte? youve got to have some protocol and frequency set. that will dictate how you receive the data and what your options are. || you can create something simple using esp32 and a good temperature sensor... its pretty simple usecase..."
raspberry monitoring,"hey guys, i am building a remote monitoring system for a 250 kva generator and have been thinking about using raspberry pi as the gateway device considering its low cost but i am worried about its reliability and durability. does anyone have experience with something similar? should i proceed with it or look for a better alternative? || get an industrial version of the pi like the kunbus revolution pi, its made for industrial use. || rpis have two big flaws. 1. they get hot. 2. they wear out the sd cards where the os lives. the heat issue is fairly easy to solve. install a heat sink and get a well ventilated aluminum enclosure with a fan. storage can be solved with a usb ssd drive, but youre likely to run into power issues, so youll likely want a powered usb hub. || open energy monitor has already built this for you using a raspberry pi."
raspberry monitoring,"tldr started with a diy bbq propane tank monitor made from a beagleboard with aws iot and now have a fully commercialized product for large residential and commercial propane tanks. ama. four years ago, i started tinkering with aws iot. partly driven by my interest in iot and cloud applications, and partly because it was covid and i had nothing else better to do, i dove into the world of iot. it all began with a simple concept could i hook up my dads bbq to the cloud to see when hes grilling? the idea was straightforward, but where do i begin? for days, i searched online for a platform i could use to put this prototype together. i fell in love with the beagleboard mainly because it was simple to program and didnt come preloaded with much software, unlike a raspberry pi. the boards also came with a lot of ios, which was great since i wasnt sure how many ios i would need to make this work. i also found a pressure gauge and a threeway propane tank hose connector to connect the sensor. lastly, i packaged it up with a power supply and leveraged wifi to transmit the data from the device to the cloud. now, this was prechatgpt days, so i had to learn how to build the program by leveraging forums and documentation. after a week or so of building out the program, i had somewhat of a prototype. with parts in hand, i drove over to my dads house and hooked it up. to my surprise, it actually worked! i was stoked. my dad... he didnt really care, but nonetheless, it was a win in my book. with this win under my belt, i asked myself, could i go bigger? so i did. i googled the nearest propane distributor in the area, walked in cold, and asked hey, ive got this propane tank monitor made from offtheshelf parts. would you be willing to allow me to hook up 2 or 3 to some of the tanks you have in the field? to my complete surprise, they said yes. so i marched ahead and built 3 additional units however, this time, they read a tank gauge instead of tank pressure. i mean, these things were absolute monsters. however, everything fit nicely within a 12x6x4 enclosure. it did require some 3dprinted plastic parts to make everything steady, but it fit! thus was born the logi1 tank monitor. the enclosure contained 1x beagleboard 1x programming cable 1x hologram usb cellular dongle 1x taoglas antenna 2x lithium polymer battery packs 1x tank gauge sensor cable i then went on to purchase 3 sets of equipment and hardware, built them up, and deployed them. but i still had a serious problem despite getting these monstersized battery packs, the device would only survive for about 1 month, which became a huge hassle to replace consistently. but we got them deployed anyway. heres an image of one of the very first ones out in the field. what a beast! despite all the setbacks, the propane distributor i was working with was stoked, so i knew i had something valuable here. there was still the lingering problem of batteries dying in the field. so i teamed up with someone specializing in electronics who i had worked with before. together, we set out to solve the battery problem once and for all. six months later, we gave birth to logi2 our first attempt at a solarpowered propane tank monitor. it was a bit ambitious, i agree, but given our experience in the space, we knew we could find a balance. with the help of programs in michigan, we were able to cover most of the initial board manufacturing costs and deploy 40 units in the field. again, to our surprise, our hypothesis held true theres enough solar power outside to sustain the energy required from our tank monitor, even in the most shaded areas. we were getting closer! with the logi2, we were able to get a sense for how much solar power was available on an average propane tank, and how much we could harvest and if we could sustain the product on solar alone and we did! so we pressed on, and after some finetuning and a custom enclosure design, we released the logi3 earlier this year. to our surprise again, weve gained tremendous traction and positive reviews from homeowners looking to track their propane tanks throughout the year, but most importantly, without the need to replace batteries which typically happens at the worst times i.e., when its cold out or raining. the entire journey has been a thrill since the beginning. its given me the opportunity to learn about iot and its crossfunctional requirements. in the process, ive had to learn how to program firmware, establish a scalable cloud architecture, develop a mobile app android ios, mechanical design, plastic injection molding, printed circuit board manufacturing, marketing, and selling online. ama regarding the product, hardware architecture, the data collected, cloud architecture, mobile app development, mechanical design, selling online, etc.! || this is very cool. congratulations. i work in cellular connectivity for iot and go to a lot of hardware shows. i really enjoy hearing about how solutions in the field come to be. || very cool. what does onboardingimplemtation look like and what do you charge the homeowners for your solution? || very cool man! would love to know about your cloud architecture."
raspberry monitoring,"i ideally wanna average the color pixels on my monitor and send it to the rgb lights to help with atmosphere while i game. kinda lost in what brand to go with, ive got a raspberry pi ready to go but im also foreign with the tech. any guidance would be appreciated! || i followed link for back of monitor sync and it works really well. if youre not doing back of monitor sync but more like rgb set up around the room, id recommend ws2812 led strip any brand really, search ebay or aliexpress or amazon firmware on an esp32 sorry i dont think supports raspberry pi, search amazon etc for a wemos d1 mini they are super cheap software to sense your monitor and send to wled i reckon the above combo could get what youre chasing."

raspberry monitoring,"hi, i am a beginner in this field. looking for advise. i hope you all can assist me on this. i have a project which requires to connect few sensors to iot system and monitor it using mobile apps over gsmgprs module as the area do not have any internet connectivity. the mobile apps also can switch on the relay. so, i have done some google and found out about several key items in iot and this is my current understanding of the items 1. thingsboard iot platform that have multi tenancy and can show sensors data and dashboard. it also have mobile apps. i also have read about openremote. 2. industrial iot iot devices with rugged casing to withstand the environment 3. iot gateway it is required to connect all sensors and gsmgprs module to this gateway so that it can pass the sensor data to a web server. raspberry pi can become iot gateway but for industrial purposes, rather use industrial iot gateway. maybe i am wrong. 4. node red same like thingsboard, but only for dashboard and rule, maybe? 5. mqtt protocol to transmit data from sensor to node red thingsboard, maybe? 6. ionic react software framework to develop custom mobile apps by using react and ionic instead of react native my questions are 1. can i really substitute raspberry pi with an industrial iot gateway? or is my understanding is wrong? 2. is it easier to use thingsboard mobile apps instead of develop custom mobile apps using ionic react? 3. can i use a vps to host a server debianubuntu installed with public accessed node red thingsboard mqtt and receive data from iot gateway sensors gprs module? 4. is my setup and configuration correct? how is it actually to setup my iot system and mobile apps to achieve my goal? thank you for reading my wall of text. i really appreciates your advise in this matter. || there is a lot to breakdown here. let me see if i can answer as best as possible. 1. thingboard attempts to be a onestop shop for all things iot, providing endpoint ingestion, data processing, data storage, data dashboarding visualization, rules and alerts. 2. industrial iot this is a specific implementation of iot for industrial use cases, typically requiring connection to scada systems, historians, noninternet protocols opcua, modbus, rs232, rs422, etc. typically, more secure, and requiring special gateways to connect to the on premises services, and transform harmonize the data into a iot compliant protocol and payload. 3. gateway a gateway is a way to connect sensors and devices to iot services, that might not be able to do it on their own the gateway collects and sends, possibly transforms the data prior to sending if a sensor is a smart sensor it typically can send the data without a gateway. a gateway can often provide edge processing like machine learning prediction, video processing, aggregation of data, rules and notification services without having to send the data to the could for such analytics to take place. 4. nodered programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, apis and online services. nodered can run on the gateway, on the edge, or on the cloud or all three at the same time. it isnt typically a gateway, but rather one part of the services that a gateway provides. 5. mqtt one of a few protocols that iot uses to communicate data. it is two way sendreceive. it is not tied to any specific software, product, or platform. it is open like ftp, telnet and sits alongside http and aqmp as some of the primary protocols to send iot data. 6. iconic react software development framework, not associated with iot. for your questions 1. it is possible for a raspberry pi to be used as an industrial iot gateway, but it typically requires more than just some python code. you could use something like openplc to build out an rpi as an industrial gateway plccontroller. 2. i dont have any direct experience with thingboard, but it looks like a nice platform to start with, as it is an all in one solution. i work for microsoft and we have a apaas platform called iot central. you can set it up in about 1 minute and it has everything you need. here is a walkthrough that you can deploy and start to get data within 5 minutes using your mobile device as the iot device... 3. if you want to use a vm, you will have to deploy, configure, manage, and support all the services you want to use. typically not the best approach. but is an option like thinboard, or azure iot central 4. i dont know what you are attempting to builddeploy, so i dont know if your ideas will support your needs. but i hope i help with my explanation... you can pm me for more info if you need it. || dont get confused by the fancy name of things focus on what is the function you need. for example, you could also use a 3g4g dongle on the raspberry pi or use machine to machine connectivity on the sensors themselves. depending on the country and area where you are 2g may already have been depricated, so make sure to check before deployment. give the details you have provided of your project its too high level to provide more feedback. i would recommend to share a diagram of how each thing should communicate with each other for more helpful advice. || you might want to look at sensaphone instead of trying to roll your own. they work very well and are very reliable."
raspberry monitoring,"ive got lots of raspberry pis. so, i wrote a facility to monitor them and send me a text message via aws iot if something goes wrong. here is the code. || nice writeup! one question though if the monitoring rpi aka the broker dies or the cron job fails, what alerts do you get?"
raspberry monitoring,"hello everyone, recently ive designed a pcb which reads some sensors and sends the data through wifi, a few friends were interested so i ordered a few for them but now im stuck with the following problem. my current setup involves, apart from the pcb, a raspberry which runs a mosquitto mqtt broker, home assistant and a cloudflared instance. all of this is so i can monitor and send commands to the pcb through home assistant and mqtt, while cloudflared allows me to reach my raspberry from outside my home. now, if i wanted to do the same for them i should buy a raspberry for each of them and configure it in the same way, but theyre not tech savvy and it would be a bit overkill for what they need. they just need a way to read the data sent from the pcb, adjust a few parameters and send some commands. i was wondering what are the options in this case. i dont want to host a server locally, so i was more oriented toward cloud services. also, something that doesnt require too many manual configuration to add a new pcbdecide would be great. two options i considered 1. a cloud server where i can setup a few vms one for each device and install home assistant os on each of them. this requires a lot of manual work but would be similar to what i already have. 2. azure iot central. i didnt know much about this service, but i experimented a bit with the portal and the sdks and they seem quite interesting i just need to create a new device on the portal and paste the id and key in the code, everything else is managed by the sdks. this requires more rework of the code though. do you know of any other option? ||  || oh boy do i know this pain. youd basically need to do everything like youre making a small business but just for friends. thats probably not how you want to spend your time and obviously its for friends so you dont want to charge for it. i work for a startup called golioth and we do infrastructure stuff like this. we have a free dev tier for up to 50 devices, would that be enough? im assuming this might be like an esp32 project? if so, you could use our new espidf sdk and use that to connect to the cloud. then your friends could tap into the data directly from the console or use external visualization services. theres a new settings service, they could even send commands directly from the console if they want. heres the quickstart if you want to check out how to connect || if you can package your appcode as a docker container, checkout balenacloud. free for the first five or ten devices, i dont remember exactly. you will just need to write the image to sdcards and send the pis out. as long as there is internet, it should all work."
raspberry monitoring,"hello guys, first time posting here. i am designing a home monitoring system and one of the things i want is a wireless noise level sensor. but im only able to findand is not what i want wired sensors controled by modbus expensive outdoor systems that use protocols like lorawansigfox wich is not what i want. company devices that require either suscribtion, work with a closed solutionapp and are not easy to integrate into my own system even if some of them offer things like an api they still require some propietary software in the midle or something similar all in all im loking for something like a zigbeebluetoothwifimqtt device that i can controll from something like a raspberry pi with my own code. || you could do something like this. using an esp32 esp8266. personally i would do micropython, wifi, mqtt. || if you have an old android phone laying around you could make an android app to push the phones sensor data over mqtt. i think there may be a few apps out there already that do this. || a cheap rtsp camera and ffmpeg?"
raspberry monitoring,"hi, im a python developerdata scientistpretend data engineer. ive been fiddling more and more with edge computing, raspberry pis and arducams and such. i just bought a multifuction sensor and a aws iot core specific gateway. i bought them before learning because i like to do hands on learning. i know very little about networking, signals, or any of this. im reasonably smart and very curious to learn. what resources would you point me to? my goal is to setup a realtime stream of data from the sensor and use grafana to monitor it. i know this is a big ask, but what resources would you point a noob like me to. thanks in advance! || check out the certs from you mind sharing the model of the sensors and gateway?"
raspberry monitoring,"hi guys, im here for some guidance if you would have a minute? x200b im looking to create a temperature monitoring setup for some extreme temps, with a big bunch of sensor units and an app to monitor them all. it would be a proofofconcept approach, but packaged enough to be a prealpha product towards first clients who know what theyre getting into. i want to keep it simple and straightforward on the hardware side, for both myself and them. x200b my current idea is to have an eth connection for each unit have them call a public api endpoint to upload new measurements. the receiving application runs in the cloud and will provide a monitoring dashboard to the users. keeping it simple to avoid issues with client network firewalls, ports, etc, but looking at mqtt for the future. on the hardware side, ive currently got a raspberry pi b with a pmod hat tc1 module up and running doing exactly this, but i want it creaper and smaller. currently im looking into a orange pi zero running armbian the eth poe is a nice feature, more straightforward to install if the client setup allows it together with for example a max31855k. x200b i have a few questions or issues with the current plan though unlike the raspberry hat, ill need to look at gpio wiring for this i guess? not sure i can find back a diagram for this possible python module to control it. shouldnt be too hard but need to investigate im wondering how i connect this sensor in the best way, i just use jumper wires or solder these to the board? feels very much not like a product id like to send to a client though, but then again i dont know, ive never looked inside alpha versions of iot company sensors same for the local software, itll be all on an sd card, for anyone to pull and and start messing with ill also have to 3d print a cover to hold both pcbs pi sensor. x200b overall im wondering if there are no better or even easier options for me, keeping in mind that im not a hardware expert, there is no big budget and i do have some time pressure. suggestions on both hardware software architecture choices are welcome! x200b as a next step, ive already had a look at the chinese manufacturers eg dragino? which provide whitelabel sensors, and i guess it will be either this or creating some custom pcbs. i dont like being stuck to something proprietary hardware or software though. any suggestions on this is welcome as well! i have no clue where to start there, but thats a story for another time. first i would like to focus on getting a clientworthy v0.1 upandrunning. x200b thanks in advance! || id look at to see if they have a sensor. its not necessarily cheaper than a rpisensor, but its a lot more practical. as long as you can use wifi. and if its a simple sensor, its pretty cheap atomsensor would be in the range of 15. it basically removes most if not all of the hardware fiddling as long as they have a usable sensor. general temperature is no issue. not sure what extreme temperatures are, but if you are using a pt100, then any resistance measurement will do."
raspberry monitoring,"first of all, my apologies if this is the inappropriate sub to ask this. i have omron blood pressure monitor with ble capabilities. i want to replace the ble module with my own so i can connect to it with my own app for testing purposes i swear. i opened it up and saw the little module im holding has model number and according to that link, it says device ble module. i dont recognize the little pins that are connecting the main circuit board to the ble module if thats what it is. is there like a raspberry pi or nrf boards that i can buy to replace the ble connection, to receive the data from this blood pressure monitor from the replaced ble module? am i oversimplifying this process? is it even possible? thank you || i dont think you need to replace the ble module. in fact, replacing the ble module will not make it easier. just use a generic ble app to see what data the device sends, andor write your own app. ble is ble, regardless of which module is used. || yes, it is a ble module, custom designed by omron. normally, one wouldnt design a ble module like they did. instead, one would use a cots module designed by a module manufacturer, such as a ublox ninab4. but since it is an omron proprietary module, dont expect to be able to communicate with it, or emulating it from the mcu interface. at best, it exposes the hci asis, but that means a lot of work. or, its a totally proprietary protocol of unknown complexity. om the other hand, the blood pressure gatt service is standardized by the bluetooth sig. you can use basically any decent ble scanner app on your phone to view the output, or write your own app followinf the most likely, omron implements this, and the device probably implements the entire too. || you want to test the ble but you cant even figure out what your looking at? not to be mean but arent you a little over your head here?"

raspberry monitoring,"i am using google cloud and i have some raspberry pi sending some data. however, i have been looking for a way to monitor when the devices for some reason have stopped working i.e. lost power and arent sending data. i tried looking for ways to do this using iot core, but i dont see any implementation of this. i find it odd, but even the method i wanted to try, which was to open an mqtt bridge and send an alert when the device disconnects doesnt seem to work quite like i want to. basically i am able to be informed about connectdisconnect events, but mqtt connection needs to be renewed constantly so i cant raise an alarm for a real disconnection. reading more about it, apparently the protocol has something in place called last will and testament which might do what i want, however iot core doesnt support it. so after all this, i still dont have a way to be alerted of a rpi that lost connection for a while. how are people monitoring this sort of thing? i have searched a lot but i cant seem to find an adequate answer. any help will be appreciated! || check the you should see connectdisconnect events. use the following to filter the log resource.typecloudiotdevice jsonpayload.eventtypedisconnect or connect the exporter publishes the full which you can then consume from a cloud function subscribed to the same pubsub topic export const checkdeviceonline functions.pubsub.topiconlinestate.onpublishasync message const logentry json.parsebuffer.frommessage.data, base64.tostring const deviceid logentry.labels.deviceid let online switch logentry.jsonpayload.eventtype case connect online true break case disconnect online false break default throw new errorinvalid message type ...write updated state to firebase... source iot engineer at google, || you have to do heart beat ping pong events every x seconds, if a device fails to respond you raise the alarm || in a typical professional environment you would setup a proper monitoring system something like prometheus. you would install a nodeexporter on each of the raspberry pi, a prometheus server e.g. in gcp and then a system to watch those metrics e.g. grafana or to alert via chatemailpager when something is wrong alertmanager integrated in prometheus. itll take you a little bit to get the hang of it, but i believe its a good time investment as its an industry standard by now."
raspberry monitoring,"raspberry pi 4 can now officially boot from usb finally! that means you can use ssd or hdd drives instead of sd card. in todays video i will show you how you can do that step by step and you dont even have to attach a monitor to your raspberry pi. or if you prefer to read check the full article sd cards can cause issues and are much slower than ssds. since i have a raspberry pi 4 my sd card got corrupted several times. so i had to remove it, format it, install os again and restore all of my configurations that i had. doing this can be really frustrating, so i waited for the official raspberry pi 4 usb boot as a kid for its birthday. cheers, kiril || thanks! any information on the performance of a 10 usd usb flashdrive like the ones you linked vs a sd card at similar pricepoint? edit this is the best i have found so far, but it only has data for a pretty expensive usb ssd. concludes that usb flashdrives are about 34 times faster than the tested sd card, but the tested usb flashdrives cost 2025 usd. this test does not have any data on write speeds. || yes!"

raspberry monitoring,"i need some help choosing an iot platform or service. the main goal here is to write an application to monitor and process data gathered from an indoor environment. for this, weve constructed a wsn wireless sensor network consisting of 5 peripheral nodes and a central node. the central node concentrates the data collected from the sensors and is currently doing some light processing and controlling a couple of actuators. the next step is to send the data to a server from which i can fetch the data later and use it in my program. ive tried using thigspeak but its a freemium solution and has a pretty low ceiling. ive also tried using domoticz its great because i can keep the data on a raspberry pi and do everything on site, but its hard to recover the data from it. with thingspeak a simple get request did the trick. tldr need to send data from a sensor to a server preferably a local server, ideally in a raspberry pi and then recover the data from my computer. does anyone know a platform that meets these requirements? any help is appreciated. || why not just write a simple server program in whatever language you prefer and store the data in a database like mariadb or something? that way you can use normal sql to retrieve and filter data in any way you want... shouldnt take more than a couple of lines of python or whatever. || for up to five devices, azure iot central is free. || can you be a bit more specific about what data you want to send? what visualization and correlation you want and how much data you anticipate? there are some great solutions out there that are managed services in the cloud, but a little bit more specific to what you are looking for, and i can help you out maybe."
raspberry monitoring,"howdy! i have several sensors around my home to measure a few things... beer fridge temperature, outside temperature, humidity, etc, and i use a raspberry pi to consolidate sensor data and send to thingspeak all via my home wifi network. im now trying to figure out how i can send sensor data from a remote location that doesnt have wifi available, but does have cellular. my rv thats tucked away for the winter, and i want to monitor my battery bank voltage... how can i get sensor data up to the internet from remote locations? can i leverage a old android phone i have for the data capabilities? is there something which already exist? ie a usb dongle that can plug into an android phone? thanks! thoughts appreciated. || check out || sounds like you want to have a local network for your sensors plus a gateway for internet connectivity. if not, you will need internet connectivity for each sensor, which will be expensive. this would work e.g. with a rasbpi acting as gateway and local wifi access point, and a usb cellular modem or smartphone tethering for internet connectivity to the pi. i have done internet connectivity part myself on a huawei e3131 iirc 3g modem. google around for a usb modem andor wifi module that have been proven to work with your pi, and read the howtos before buying. its not exactly plug and play, but enough people have come before you that there should be a lot of tutorials out there, at least separately for making the wifi lan vs getting internet connectivity on the pi. || if one arduino can do all the monitoring you need, then an should work just fine. if you need more than one arduino, then use the cell shield for one, and then use wired connections i2c or serial to talk to the other sensors, or use to do the local communication."
raspberry monitoring,"hi, ive been having a bit of fun recently playing with a raspberry pi2 and a dht11 sensor that weve got monitoring office temperature and humidity. it just so happens that im the founder of a monitoring company called dataloop. we usually do devops stuff but there seems to be a massive overlap between infrastructure monitoring and what an iot platform provides. anyway, i have an agent that runs on a raspberry pi2. it executes nagios format plugins that are ubiquitous in the world of sysadmins. they essentially output an exit status of 0,1,2,3 ok, warn, crit, unknown and some performance data on standard out ok something0. they can be written in any language and execute by default every 30 seconds. i guess the reason for this post is to get some feedback. were not looking to pivot to iot and dont really have any pricing model setup for it. in fact, id be happy to provide free accounts to people to have a play around if they pm me. just wanted to get a bit of feedback about using nagios format scripts on iot devices and if thats a crazy idea or not. ive started a repository with my script and have a few friends looking to contribute theirs soon. || have you cross posted to rraspberrypi or rraspberrypiprojects? || also, for what it is worth, i think this could be very beneficial to sysadmins, even more so if the iot device was as simple as plug, configure a bit, and leave it alone. i dont know what all nagios can and does take as input currently, so dont beat me too much for being a dingdong. but, for example, you could have a moisture sensor in certain areas that would alert nagios in the event of unwanted moisture. same for door openingclosing events, temperature sensors like the one you mention, motion sensors, trip wires, and a lot more i cant think of because i need more coffee. either way cool idea and best of luck. || this is an interesting idea which ive toyed with in the past. just a few random thoughts i looked at using opsview nagios in my own home monitoring setup for things like temperature, electricity consumption, while the graphing and alerting is great i found it means a lot more custom integration work than with using something like openhab which there is a prebuilt interface for almost every common home automation standard persistence layer etc. in the end there were just solutions better suited to the problem. recently ive been playing with grafana and influxdb for graphing and storing historic stats at home and its what i currently recommend when people ask. its something i use a lot at work im a devops engineer its a great solution for graphing but not that integrated into the wider ecosystem. which leads to a wider issue that most people want one product that does graphing, alerts, triggers, scenes etc, but there isnt one really. openhab is the nearest it gets, but if you like stats thats a weak point. how does your idea interface with say the nest api or an mqtt data feed? i assume itd need a custom check which then becomes a pain. it also seems like people have explored zabbix for similar solutions too."
raspberry monitoring,"the internet of things buzzword is getting more traction and software companies device manufactures are in a land rush to get something to market. as a result, ive been seeing a lot of frameworks like and pop up that provide a way for you to get sensor data from your embedded device to their proprietary cloud and then apis to play with the data. i have two main disconnects with all of this 1. with iot platforms like these in general, the main selling point is that you can get sensor data from all over the world and use that for your application. besides weather and environment apps that can monitor temperature, humidity, air quality, and so on, what kind of utility would that have? in other words, what kind of useful applications could come out of having a light intensity sensor, accelerometer, proximity sensor, or any other generalpurpose sensing device connected to the internet for all to analyze? 2. since everyone has their own cloud platform for managing data, it seems like its pretty unsustainable. had a piece about this and brought up the need for ieee iot standards. still, even if a standard comes about for communication between embedded devices and servers, companies will still want to have their own clouds and data services. its a similar problem to trying to communicate with people who primarily use google hangouts, facebook messenger, or whats app for their human communication needs, since nothing integrates with anything else and cant easily be brought under singular service. where is the endgame here? anyone have any thoughts on this? || ieee, w3c, and ietf are all actively working on standards at various levels... ieee at low level networking, ietf at the protocol and data interchange, and w3c at the data content levels. if the various cloud infrastructures adopt these standards it becomes easy to integrate between one or more of them. most of these clouds though arent really for everyday users. look at xively, they are being used by a manufacturer of freezers for labs, xively provides the infrastructure to power all the data for all the freezers, but any lab manager only cares about and sees their own freezers. which may be in multiple locations. || ive always had the same feeling about the use of iot. i guess my answer is i dont really know what future utility these data streams provide, but i do look forward to the innovations that could come from it. i think that what zymbit city brings to the table is a potential showcase of these innovative projects, and the availability of subscribing to others data and leveraging those data streams for your own application. i remember seeing a project that used a microphone to detect gunshots, and then triangulating the position of the gunshot using multiple microphones. it really opened my eyes to how cool ideas are out there and can benefit from the iot. what if an entire community used raspberry pis to upload those audio streams? i think the potential applications are endless, but i too havent wrapped my head around the possible utilities of iot aside from weather tracking. as for standardization, i believe the hackaday article pointed out something is coming in 2017. my guess is as iot becomes less of a buzzword and more of a reality, then standardization is imminent. after a few years, cloud services will probably boil down to a few large competitors, similar to the big players like apple and google of today. || check this out as uexfederalie says, the internet of things is a description of a reality always keep that in mind. it is not a thing in it self. its a certain time in history. i think this is a good way to remind yourself that devices in the age of iot are not supposed to be categorized together. distinct problems will call for distinct solutions, and simply thinking that throwing some iot at a problem will help solve it will get you nowhere. i think the greatest benefits of this revolution as some people call it are dependent on global commitment to securitystandards. with stuff such as apple watch, nest, amazon echo etc. coming out, there will be a abundance of data relating to language, health and so forth that could really help us solve some cultural and societal problems. privacy and datasecurity is obviously two ethical areas that must be discussed thoroughly before any globaldatacollectioneffort can be set up."
