raspberry,"as part of my university project, my school has asked for an expert review before i proceed further. ive built a prototype biometric accesscontrol system that combines face recognition with a secondary factor pin or push notification. system overview hub microservice architecture on an ubuntu server receives camerapin data from verification nodes over mqtt verifies user and requests the lock to open communicates to the cloud api over rest verification node raspberry pi with camera, touchscreen display, and pinpad publishes camera feed and pin entries to the hub via mqtt lock door device esp32 with servo motor and lipo battery subscribes to unlock commands over mqtt and opens the lock backend cloud api nest.js service in azure registers hubs, handles pushnotification, and handles third party webhooks mobile app ionic angular interface for user settings, device lists, and remote unlocks cicd pipeline github actions for build, test, container image build, and deploy to azure i would like to receive any feedback, suggestions, or experiences you have on improving this architecture. thank you! || nice concept. heres a few cents from someone who worked in these areas 1 verification node ensure your data payload is not heavy, try to process as much of the image locally, or else you risk impacting your brokers performance also increase message size limits on mqtt if you like you can combine the lock with the verification node, makes your architecture simpler, theres no need to have more components when your rpi already has sufficient gpios. yes, youll need a driver and maybe a small battery, but the reduction in software coding across multiple languages, wiring, distributed architecture, etc. is worth sometimes. 2 hub suggest moving the facial recognition service onto the verification node, or at least big chunks of it. mqtt isnt best used for that purpose. if your architecture is super necessary you can use ble transfer pending distance, and then as soon as you get the image trigger the processing on the hub. 3 cloud application google i would try and combine those as much as possible. would even optin for serverless and be done with it. || image is too bad resolution at least on mobile. can t see labels. can you list the functionalities you are expecting as user stories ? it helps identify the persona involved, the functionalities, the expected result."

raspberry,"im working on a lowpower, offgrid, bird call audio streaming project using a raspberry pi zero 2 w that collects microphone data from multiple esp32s3 nodes over wifi, compresses the audio, and uploads it to my home computer via a cellular module 4g lte. however, i dont know which cellular module to pick. i only need a 4 mbps upload speed at most, and it must work in the usa, and have relatively low power draw as i will be using a solar setup in the woods. im trying to avoid the relatively expensive 50 cat 4 modulesi dont need that much speed, cost, or power draw. i am not looking for a chip, but a full module. what are your cheapest, usafriendly recommendations? || i have a used couple usb based lte modems, around 25 on amazon with success. but im really interested in your bird listening with esp32s. what does your setup look like if you can share? i was thinking about doing the same around our farm. || i dont have an answer, but i wish you luck on this cool project!"

raspberry,"hi folks, were currently developing a field prototype using a raspberry pi 5 to gather realworld data for an application. im reaching out to the community to get your recommendations on usb wireless network adapters and mobile dongles. wifi dongle we need the capability to attach an external antenna to the dongle. while it doesnt need to support the latest wifi standards, it would be beneficial if it operates on both the 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands. mobile dongle although were based in the uk, our prototype will undergo field testing in kenya. therefore, we require support for the following bands 2g gsm 900 mhz and 1800 mhz 3g umts 2100 mhz 4g lte band 3 1800 mhz, band 20 800 mhz, band 7 2600 mhz were prioritizing reliability and compatibility for these prototypes, but any costeffective solutions would be greatly appreciated as our funding budget is tight. i really appreciate any advice or recommendations you could provide! thanks in advance! || for your wifi dongle, check out this repo there are a lot of options out there, but finding something that is plug and play compatible with an intree linux kernel driver will save a lot of time and hassle. || fyi the majority of cellular dongles requires gui setup which is a pita. look for m2m type dongles which can then be controlled via at commands modemmanager. wifi is easier, you can find stuff there, most likely realtek or mediatek based should work fine. something like rtl88xx based is a decent priceperformance ratio"
raspberry,"hello, i want to create a small wifi device with an ai voice api. it will have a button to record audio and another to take photos. there will be no display interface, all communication will happen through audio. here are the components i have in mind microcontroller or microcomputer button for record audio button for taking pictures speaker microphone camera led status indicator rechargeable battery usbc charging cable optional camera flash fisheye lens, a wheel to adjust the volume i was thinking of using an esp32 because its smaller, simpler, and better in terms of battery consumption. however, i realized that esp32 camera modules are only 25mp, and i would like something with higher resolution. so, maybe a raspberry pi would be better to use a higherquality camera, even with a wide lens. at the same time, i think it could get more complicated in terms of development and energy management. what do you think? what would you choose based on this small overview? || i think it all depends on the amount of work you are willing to do, with esp32 you can do all of this and even though the camera is inferior there is a lot of improvement and treatment that you can do, i am a big esp enthusiast and i have read many of these on 4621410111 . based on your project, i believe that you will need more than one esp32 if you choose it, which will consequently not overload any of them at the processing level. i dont know much about raspberry, but it must certainly be simpler due to the processing power and superior modules, if money is not a problem, dont think twice and go for raspberry. || id go with the pi"
raspberry,"i did some projects in college with raspberry pi, arduino and microchip microcontrollers. i want to get back into it, what board would you recommend, which one do you use? thanks! || esp32 is pretty good to start with, its cheap. it comes with a nice sdk espidf. it has great connectivity wifi and bluetooth, lots of good documentation and a big community. you can use the ardiuno ide with it, although i dont like it or use it, it makes getting started easy. || it depends. what are the requirements of your project? || checkout walter. walter is an esp32s3 based, open source, module that also has cellular iot ltem and nbiot. the module can be programmed in arduino, espidf, micropython, toitlang and zephyr. you can find all info on and on the discord there is also a growing community."

raspberry,"i am a complete beginner in anything hardware. im a software developer. my company however is asking me to build a wearable camera. theyre willing to get me any components i need. it should have a camera on the front and a camera on the back. it needs to combine these two videos into a single 350 deg video and stream stream this feed to a server. i did some research on cameras and micro controllers. i have a few questions 1. what protocol should i use for streaming the video? 1.1. internally from the camera to the processor 1.2. over the internet. from the processor to a server. i noticed that a lot of camera systems use rtsp to stream video. its that a good idea for this use case? 2. if i use 2 fisheye cameras, will it be possible to stitch them together on the processor before streaming to a server 3. what processor should i use for prototyping? raspberry pi, arduino or anything else like that i am very new to all this we might need to add more processing functionality in the future. something like basic object detection that runs in the same processor. || good luck. im a hardware engineer with a heap of experience and this sounds daunting even to me! you might have more luck posting over on rembedded for the hardwareprocessing input on stuff. || such an interesting problem to solve for a software developer. id be thrilled if this was given to me. for the 3 point you will have to use raspberry pi or other alternatives of same processing power. arduino will not be able to handle this much processing . on rpi you will be able to use ffmpeg to do video processing. || just buy an insta 360 youre a bit late to the party"
raspberry,"im thinking of adding some remote control to a couple of gates in the property opening, closing and checking the state, basically and i was wondering if anyone could help me get started in the right direction on what kind of devices i could use to do that. the gates already have eletric motors and remote controls but i want to be able to control them and see their state remotely not just from a few meters away... im ok with general electronics and ive also played with arduinos and raspberrys so a more diy solution would be ok. my doubts are more towards the connectivity of the devices to the networkweb. ive never done much iot itself so i dont know whats being used nowadays... || id break this down into 3 parts gate control state tracking communication for gate control, depending on how standard the remote controls are, you can just solder some leads to the button pads and use gpio pins on raspi or esp32 to easily control them. youll have to replace the battery unless you wire up some kind of permanent power source to the battery connectors on the remote. for state tracking, outdoorrated limit switches or contact switches would work well here. you dont want to rely purely on software state, cause what happens if the gate gets stuck halfway through? these can easily be wired to more gpio pins. some might need to be i2c and there are expansion boards for that. communication depends on if your wifi can reach the gates or not. if not, use one of the iot data providers. then its a matter of coding up the state transitions, think state machine pattern, for gate transitions. then send that to either one of the iot platforms or your own server. you can also look into using something from homeassistant, either hardware that integrates with it or write your code to integrate with it. || i would not rely on wifi if these gate are for security. wifi hacking is to easy. cell phone comm is much more secure. good luck || heres my .02. fair warning! i work with limited budget! i originally designed a mailbox alert project based on arduino nano using cheap radio frequency transmitterreceiver modules. that worked great on the workbench but was very unreliable between workbench and mailbox. the design evolved to using an esp07 3. it has an esp8266 and builtin wifi that can use either an onboard antenna or an external antenna. i use an external antenna mounted outside the metal mailbox and the device easily connects to my home network from the mailbox. i have another esp8266based project connected to my garage door, which is probably similar to what you are doing. its got a relay in parallel with the normal garage door button so it can open and close the door. it also detects when the door is opening and sends an mqtt message to my mission control microcontroller based on esp32. mission control does various things, such as announcing the door opening on our alexa and warning if the door is open for too long i do have my senior moments. in addition, i created a shortcut on my iphone so i can ask siri to open and close the door. everything works using mqtt and various free or inexpensive cloud services that mostly use rest apis. side note i set up a guest network on my router with client isolation to keep devices from hacking each other. the microcontrollers dont connect to each other directly its all through an mqtt server in the cloud. so beware, if the network is out which is very rare for me, they are dead in the water. actually they dont die any data coming in is cached in a littlefs file until the network comes back up. i currently use a particle photon p2 to monitor my septic panel and have had an excellent experience, unlike mmanulis. imho they have excellent tools and great documentation online. im considering buying a particle boron. it has a builtin cell phone circuit and includes free cell service and are currently on sale for about 30. that avoids the issue of my cable internet going down as it uses cell service to access the internet and can therefore send notifications reliably."
raspberry,"this is an automatically moving chessboard i know how to code web elements, work with chess api and maybe even use raspberry pi, but if someone who knows better than me can tell me roughly how to make this would be much appreciated. making a small board for myself since its fun i started learning chess so it will be easier. || this would be a huge undertaking for someone that has not worked with hardware or mechanical. you would need to create a sort of track with a magnet, track positions of each piece, engage magnet when it is time to move pieces, have a route algorithm that prevents knocking pieces over as the desired one moves etc. || there is nothing a beginner can ask that has not already been done many many times over maybe there are some ideas there you can use. good luck || youtube"
raspberry,"fundamentally speaking it seems iot is focused on sending data from a device over tcp to something that gathers the data. yes i know this is a broad brush im using but im not far off. when i look for examples i see mainly devices sending data to a local server eg raspberry pi or such. if they send data to the cloud typically they use a service that exists for diy projects. an example would be adafruit io. i have an account on a server. what i would like to do is send data to something on that server that i have created to display and store on my own website. the problem is i dont see anyone doing this. i cant find discussions of it. im sure its out there. i cant be the only one. does none know where i can go to learn? see examples? is it just too hard for the hobbyist? || adafruit io is a good starting point for aggregating and visualizing data. also arduino cloud. for a local or hosted solution you could check out thats a nolowcode environment. very easy to get started with. especially if your nodes use mqtt to send data. || there are a few different architectures. we can boil them down to two for ease of conversation, but it loses quite a bit of nuance regarding the actual implementation. those two approaches are send directly to a service custom or not send to a gatewayintermediary which sends to a service however you get the data there mqtt, rest, graphql, etc. the something on that server is an api that receives the data and stores it into some kind of data store. think about it through the lens of goals or workflows. try this exercise, imagine the system exists, ignoring what that actual system design is, its performing the thing youre after. what is it doing? for example, i want to monitor some equipment. the sensors are collecting the data and uploading that data somewhere. my goal is to get an sms whenever a temperature is too high. another goal i have is to get weekly report showing the temperature fluctuations over the course of the week at hourly intervals. this tells me i need to record the data from each temperature sensor, store it somewhere and have an app that can read that data and show graphs to the user or send sms messages when the temperature is above a certain threshold. this looks like two systems data acquisition storage from sensors and userfacing webmobile app. ill leave the userfacing app part to you to research, plenty of yt videos on building admin panels, reporting, etc. when it comes to data acquisition and storage and without knowing your technical background or goals, here are some approaches you can take with different proscons cots oss approach use one of the multitude of existing hosted solutions, like adafruit io, aws iot, etc. use their tools to store the data in whatever the native storage they provide. your userfacing app will then connect to those data stores. custom approach build your own server using whatever languageframework you like. that server would connect to the devices, receive the data and store it in some kind of storage engine. my suggestion would be to start with postgresql if you dont have something youre already comfortable with. which approach you go with is up to you and your goals. || google mqtt. you would be running a mqtt broker, and your sensors would publish, and your application would subscribe."
raspberry,"im looking to get something like a pendant or a bracelet with a single button, that when pressed would send out a notification or a call to pre programmed contacts. ive seen something like this, but they are only available in some regions and usually come with subscriptions and their own call centers that handle those emergencies. what i would assume i would need is a button that can be programmed to send out a signal to some base station that then could be programmed to send messages or calls. this device would be for my grandmother, shes alright but im being preemptive, she walks her dog daily so the system would need to have some range to it. im not sure what type of signal could carry good enough range, maybe like lora or something like that? and for base station, what would i need? something like an arduino or even raspberry pi? any suggestions would be nice. im not too experienced with stuff like this, maybe some of you have made a system that would work in such a way? || to be honest, i wouldnt be considering relying on a home built safety critical system. i dont believe that it would be reliable enough. commercial systems have quality certification, and when you pay for a 247365 call centre you get 247365 peace of mind. || hello! have you considered using ble and using a mobile phone app as gateway? of course, it is just a valid solution if your mom has a mobile phone and always brings it, but it could ensure the connectivity while she walks her dog. || there are multiple base station button systems available. the only affordable way weve seen to get the range youre talking about is to go with a phone based architecture. get a ble button or badge, connect via bt to ap on phone. gps and cell connectivity from the phone. there are 911 emergency response apis though not free. we recently did a commercial system like this thats used by election poll workers, health care, courts law, and for all kinds of remote work with the public, etc. doing it on a commercial basis with reasonable security can get complex, but for your nan, easier."
raspberry,"hey, for a school project we have to make basic projects. like showing the temperature on your phone, or turning on some leds sadly i barely can replace a light bulb, so a noob proof kit would be the best solution. i found these 3 sets between these 3, which would be the easiest to use? the arduino almost 2x as expensive as the other 2 s || arduino uno r3 is your best bet for simplicity and wide support. youll be a bit more limited in what you can do, but it will be much easier to get something going. || go for esp32 what runs on arduino uno runs on esp32. basic stuff. with option to expand as per your preference || are you allowed to import electronics from china ?? this web site is just selling things you can get from china for 13 or less then the price shown."

raspberry,"hi, i have to make a technology project and i dont really know how to approach it. the project is supposed to be a smart city where every pair of students has to make a part of it. we have been assigned to make something related to solar panels and i dont really know what to do with it. we can use a node mcu mainly but if we ask we can use a raspberry pi too, also we have to use different sensors and a mqtt broker. if someone can bring me somekind of idea about what to do with it i would thank. the best i can imagine is somekind of system that could measure the volts or the ampers of something and to charge it with the solar panels, but i cant picture it on my mind. i would like to know if someone could bring me any idea and if it is possible to know also what materials i would need. i dont have any experiences with iot || its a school project so you can do few simple things connect the solar panel with the solar charge controller and battery then measure the storage rate using the current sensor by connecting it to the raspberry pi and create a dashboard using node red and you can also improve the circuit by adding lights which you can control using your dashboard.. || adding a photodetector to the circuit might be a good idea. you can detect whether its day or night and can take the device into lowpower mode in the night. also by increasing number of photodetectors you can detect the efficiency of the solar panel. if photodetector reads lower and lower values each day then that can indicate panel is covered with something and may not be able to generate power efficiently."

raspberry,"i am a software developer, and have a lot of experience with coding web appsservers etc. but i have never programmed any devices. never used a raspberry pi, etc. so looking for some direction here. i have an idea of something i want to build. essentially its multiple smart buttons something like multiple each of which trigger alexa to play a specific song on primespotifyapple music. sounds dumb, but i have some cool ideas for the context. strategy 1 the easiest way to build this is to get a bunch of program them through the flic app to trigger a web request to an aws lambda that triggers a custom alexa skill for playing a song. thats cool, sure. but over time i will want more and more of these buttons to play different songs. maybe 50 of them. and with each flic being around 35, thats not feasible. strategy 2 get a bunch of cheap bluetooth buttons from aliexpress like then id use a raspberry pi to connect to all of them. again, i dont know a whole lot about raspberry pis, but i figure i could program it to listen to these bluetooth devices to trigger web requests to an aws lambda that triggers an alexa skill. id like to be able to build this out for friends and family too one day, maybe sell them. thats far in the future, but im looking for the cheapest simplest option. is strategy 2 feasible and the best way to go about this? anything im overlooking? || im doing this with zigbee buttons and home assistant. the actual thing that plays the music has changed over the years, it has been for example mpd, mopidy and librespot and at the moment its lms. i dont know about playing music on alexa echo? from a home assistant automation but im confident that theres an integration for that. || todays agao,i have built a small remote control to trigger such things on my alexa using esp32."

raspberry,"tldr started with a diy bbq propane tank monitor made from a beagleboard with aws iot and now have a fully commercialized product for large residential and commercial propane tanks. ama. four years ago, i started tinkering with aws iot. partly driven by my interest in iot and cloud applications, and partly because it was covid and i had nothing else better to do, i dove into the world of iot. it all began with a simple concept could i hook up my dads bbq to the cloud to see when hes grilling? the idea was straightforward, but where do i begin? for days, i searched online for a platform i could use to put this prototype together. i fell in love with the beagleboard mainly because it was simple to program and didnt come preloaded with much software, unlike a raspberry pi. the boards also came with a lot of ios, which was great since i wasnt sure how many ios i would need to make this work. i also found a pressure gauge and a threeway propane tank hose connector to connect the sensor. lastly, i packaged it up with a power supply and leveraged wifi to transmit the data from the device to the cloud. now, this was prechatgpt days, so i had to learn how to build the program by leveraging forums and documentation. after a week or so of building out the program, i had somewhat of a prototype. with parts in hand, i drove over to my dads house and hooked it up. to my surprise, it actually worked! i was stoked. my dad... he didnt really care, but nonetheless, it was a win in my book. with this win under my belt, i asked myself, could i go bigger? so i did. i googled the nearest propane distributor in the area, walked in cold, and asked hey, ive got this propane tank monitor made from offtheshelf parts. would you be willing to allow me to hook up 2 or 3 to some of the tanks you have in the field? to my complete surprise, they said yes. so i marched ahead and built 3 additional units however, this time, they read a tank gauge instead of tank pressure. i mean, these things were absolute monsters. however, everything fit nicely within a 12x6x4 enclosure. it did require some 3dprinted plastic parts to make everything steady, but it fit! thus was born the logi1 tank monitor. the enclosure contained 1x beagleboard 1x programming cable 1x hologram usb cellular dongle 1x taoglas antenna 2x lithium polymer battery packs 1x tank gauge sensor cable i then went on to purchase 3 sets of equipment and hardware, built them up, and deployed them. but i still had a serious problem despite getting these monstersized battery packs, the device would only survive for about 1 month, which became a huge hassle to replace consistently. but we got them deployed anyway. heres an image of one of the very first ones out in the field. what a beast! despite all the setbacks, the propane distributor i was working with was stoked, so i knew i had something valuable here. there was still the lingering problem of batteries dying in the field. so i teamed up with someone specializing in electronics who i had worked with before. together, we set out to solve the battery problem once and for all. six months later, we gave birth to logi2 our first attempt at a solarpowered propane tank monitor. it was a bit ambitious, i agree, but given our experience in the space, we knew we could find a balance. with the help of programs in michigan, we were able to cover most of the initial board manufacturing costs and deploy 40 units in the field. again, to our surprise, our hypothesis held true theres enough solar power outside to sustain the energy required from our tank monitor, even in the most shaded areas. we were getting closer! with the logi2, we were able to get a sense for how much solar power was available on an average propane tank, and how much we could harvest and if we could sustain the product on solar alone and we did! so we pressed on, and after some finetuning and a custom enclosure design, we released the logi3 earlier this year. to our surprise again, weve gained tremendous traction and positive reviews from homeowners looking to track their propane tanks throughout the year, but most importantly, without the need to replace batteries which typically happens at the worst times i.e., when its cold out or raining. the entire journey has been a thrill since the beginning. its given me the opportunity to learn about iot and its crossfunctional requirements. in the process, ive had to learn how to program firmware, establish a scalable cloud architecture, develop a mobile app android ios, mechanical design, plastic injection molding, printed circuit board manufacturing, marketing, and selling online. ama regarding the product, hardware architecture, the data collected, cloud architecture, mobile app development, mechanical design, selling online, etc.! || this is very cool. congratulations. i work in cellular connectivity for iot and go to a lot of hardware shows. i really enjoy hearing about how solutions in the field come to be. || very cool. what does onboardingimplemtation look like and what do you charge the homeowners for your solution?

raspberry,"ive spend hours searching yesterday and today, but apart from one and a lot of versions that use a raspberry pi, im coming up empty. im looking to make a battery powered device that takes the data from nearby zigbee sensors and transmits detections over lora. i want this because an off the shelf zigbee motion sensor is 10 and can even be picked up from places like ikea. an off the shelf lora motion sensor is 60 and is harder to pick up. building my own sensor straight to lora would require a lot more soldering and time. the concept makes sense in my head, yet it doesnt seem to exist or as something that can easily be created. is there anybody who has done something like this? or has a good resource for it? i know about the espressif espzigbeesdk and the is probably a good starting point for people who are fluent in c. i however am not. i write node and python and can write some arduino code, but i feel like getting lora added to this example would make me drown thoughts or advice? || you might consider a board based on the nrf52840 the from seeedstudio is a popular one. it supports zigbee natively, so you wouldnt need a separate zigbee radio, just a lora chip. it can also be programmed using circuitpython or arduino or zephyr, and its a lot more powerefficient than the esp32."
raspberry,"hello, im currently building a system that can play videos on a screen and an trying to find a compact computer to build it on. i want it to have gps connectivity so currently im thinking about the raspberry pi 4 and the sim800l chip. i dont really know if its production ready or safe to use in the wild. thinking currently of use aws iot core also but interested in any advice from iot peeps. || i assume you mean cellular connection and not gps. sim800l is essentially 2g, and thats likely going away very soon some places have it turned off completely already. i would look into catm15g modules instead look at quectel offerings for example. for the computer, something that doesnt rely on sd cards. for gps if you need that, many of the quectel modules have this built in or its available as a small addon chip. were done this years ago, and you dont even need something like aws iot core youd be surprised with what you can do, and how many clients you can serve, with a single vps and a bit of code at a fraction of the cost. || quectel sc20x series would be a good choice with builtin 4g, gps, wifi and display support. with android or linux os. || a lot of great advice has already been given, but heres my two cents prototype engineer in the uk hardware raspberry pi is absolutely fine for what you want to do. im guessing youve got some good coding experience but not tonnes of iot experience, so going for a more popular and widely supported board like the pi 4 is a safe bet. pi 5 is available, but note that its not had the same years of patchesbug fixes that the 4 will have had. others have mentioned quectel and simcom. i highly recommend the simcom sim7600g waveshare makes a hat thatll fit your pi nicely!. its cat1 4g, has inbuilt gps, and has built in ssl support small bonus that i love!. you can also just get a usb 4gdongle which should require a lot less set up on your end. data stack you absolutely can use aws, and everything you need is in there video streaming, iot data management, web hosting if you need that, but its a labyrinth! i use it, somewhat begrudgingly, a lot and i would say while its incredibly powerful, its not often straight forward. as others have said, you can achieve what you want with potentially other ways of doing this. it could be as simple as having a webrtc client, or even simpler is hosting your video feed on a local server, then streaming that local server over the web with something like ngrok. for the localserver to ngrok case, ive actually done exactly this, having an esp32 way less powerful raspberry pi, closer to an arduino on steroids livestreaming video over a wifito4g router to a mate in germany. we used it to play scalextrics together when he was homesick! project planning final bit of advice, as others have said, is just kiss keep it simple, stupid! at least at the beginning. figure out what features you want and bottlenecks youll hit into with easy to modifyhack tech, so that idea of using a cheap android phone actually works quite nicely! couple of apps on your phone and youre golden! you could also buy a wireless cctv camera, a wireless gps tracker, and some ducttape.."

raspberry,"i am fullstack web and mobile dev, and my stack is mainly based on javascript, the react framework and node.js. i have about 5 years of coding experience so im no stranger to coding, and i am self taught so im not worried about having to study new things if the knowledge is there. my question is as the title says professionally, is there any point of starting off with arduino then moving on to raspberry pi after, or should i just start with raspberry pi? ive been doing some reading a lot yesterday, as i am completely a stranger to iot and tbh also to hardware, and i get that they serve slightly different purposes, and i might want to choose arduino for certain projects and raspberry pi for others. the thing is, i dont have a specific project in mind. i just want to start accumulating knowledge and experience that would be beneficial for me professionally. i dont want to learn something first just because it is more beginner friendly. what do you think? || i would try to think of a project first or a problem you want to solve and work backwards this. interestingly im an iot dev trying to move into the webmobile space as you can create end to end apps vs iot where you work on only a small part of the solution. || flip it around, if a electronic engineer with 5 years of experience came to you and said i want to make a software product, should i just buy a book? my guess, youd say, find a partner that knows the software or youre starting from 0 and you will always be deficient relative to your core skill. if you want to fuck around, sure, get a pi or a pico w and play around in python. but as a hardware guy, i really need my software cofounder to handle the back end and the app. so if you want to transition your career into iot, build upon the skills you have by understanding the big platforms aws, azure iot, etc. how to integrate with other ubiquitous tools like alexa, google home, homekit, home assist etc. and dont use chatgpt for career advice, lol. || you could also use micropython for iot devices, like esp32."

raspberry,"learn how to easily upload images videos and other data to a cloud storage bucket, amazon s3. this is essential for many iot applications. it is free to get started all you will need is an aws account and some simple python code! we are using a raspberry pi 4b for this video but you can use any raspberry pi model other than the pico w. i also use a raspberry pi camera in the video but really you can upload any media you want to the s3 bucket! be sure to subscribe for more raspberry pi and iotrelated videos everyone, it would be appreciated. thanks! || hey, thanks for putting this up. i dont need this exact thing at this moment, but im definitely bookmarking this, because whenever i say something like that, i end up needing that info like 4 months later, in just enough time that i never find it again. great project and thanks for helping with it."
raspberry,"hi, so i am currently working on a low power expandable car gps tracker used to track your own car if it gets stolen, i have 90 of the base code written and before i make a first prototype for a real world test sell a unit to a friend and monitor it to improve it i need to find a way to be able to send location details back to the server to then be processed into a usable map and logs. any suggestions on modules that can be used to get a 4g or 5g signal so that i can use the network to send the data. the reason it has to be 4g at least is that 3g is being cut off in the next few months and 2g is long dead already. || check the sixfab 4glte cellular modem kit for raspberry pi || look for lte catm1 or nbiot modems. and just for sending the location, a linux board seems like an overkill. a microcontroller devkit should be enough. check arduino, pycom or lilygo. || just search for usb lte modems with linux support. lte wont deliver more bandwidth than usb2 provides, but there are usb3 devices for 5g support. do be aware that there are basically two kinds of lte devices low bandwidth ones are used in soda machines and the like, and high bandwidth ones designed for laptop users. the former comes with data plans where you pay by the message and messages are a few hundred bytes while they later is pay by the gigabyte. has data plans for both kinds and is a quick way to understand the market. their plans are probably competitive, but i havent actually done the research."

raspberry,"ok, i purchased a 1nce sim and have a cellular modem connected to my raspberry pi. i used minicom to configure the apn and it seems to connect. i then looked at my 1nce sim information page and configured the first ip address in the subnet which has been assigned to my sim. i dont see any information about my next hop routergateway, so im not sure how to configure a default route to the internet. i dont need to contact the sim from the internet, its just reporting data up. does anyone have experience with 1nce sims? || followup i followed the instructions on this page and after dhcp ran, i looked at the log, noticing it showed it was configuring a pointtopoint connection with my host number 1 and the remote as 2. i then guessed that maybe i dont really need to use up my allocated bandwidth with dhcp and could just configure my own ptp connection, since 1nces web page tells me that im allocated my own 30 subnet, behind a nat. that seemed to work just fine. then, i configured a route to my server via the wwan0 interface such that all other traffic continues over the wifi. it all seems to be working find now sending 5 byte udp packets with the temp and thats all! just what i was after! || did you figure this out? i need the gateway address to set the route. || tried contacting 1nce?"

raspberry,"i have great enthusiasm and have a bit of experience in iot and hacking with raspberrypi, arduino, nodemcu, etc. i want some cool project ideas that i can implement at my office desk just for fun or to help my daily work as a software developer. || certainly! integrating iot into your office environment can be both fun and functional. here are some iot project ideas that might inspire you smart desk autolighting use light sensors and leds to provide automatic desk lighting based on ambient light conditions. occupancy sensor use pir passive infrared sensors to detect if you are at your desk or not. when youre away, it can turn off any nonessential gadgets or lights. notification light set up an led strip or a single rgb led on your desk that changes color or flashes based on notifications. for instance, it could flash red for important emails, blue for slack messages, etc. desk assistant use a raspberry pi with a microphone and speaker setup. you can use voice command libraries to create a voiceactivated assistant that can tell you your meeting schedules, take quick notes, or control other desk gadgets. indoor air quality monitor use sensors like the dht11dht22 for temperature and humidity, and the mq135 for air quality. display the information on a small oledlcd on your desk. automated plant watering system if you have a plant on your desk, you can set up a moisture sensor that detects when the soil is dry and then automatically waters the plant using a small water pump. coffeetea warmer use a temperature sensor and a heating pad to keep your drink warm. the system can alert you when your drink has cooled down to a certain temperature. task timer create a physical task timer using an led ring or display. when you start a task, set the timer, and it provides a visual representation of the time left. great for the pomodoro technique or just breaking your work into focused sprints. webcam cover use a servo motor to physically cover and uncover your webcam for added security and privacy. rfidbased computer unlock instead of typing in a password, have an rfid card or tag. when you swipe the card, it unlocks your computer. this would require a combination of hardware rfid reader and software to integrate with your computers login system. workspace environment controller combine sensors and actuators to control the environment of your workspace. for example, if the temperature goes above a certain level, a fan turns on, or if the light level goes below a threshold, a desk lamp turns on. dynamic standing desk reminder use pressure sensors to detect how long youve been sitting. if its been too long, a light or buzzer can remind you to stand up or take a break. wireless charger organizer integrate a wireless charging pad into a desk organizer. when you put your phone into a slot, it charges it. when implementing these projects, consider power management how will you power your devices and for how long, connectivity how will devices talk to each other or the cloud, and security ensure that any connected devices are secure from external threats. and remember to get any necessary permissions if youre modifying your workspace in a shared environment. enjoy hacking! || the first thing i did when i was at home indefinitely was set up a keypad to control my office stuff. i use it to flip between desktop environments, turn my lights on and off and i have seen other folks use it to control a light that shows youre on air e.g. in a meeting so folks dont wander into your office while youre in a meeting. my code is really sloppy, but plenty of tutorials out there. i just used a 9key keypad and mashed together a few tutorials in an afternoon. || uicekingthrowaway1214 iaq monitoring could help you work more efficiently. a ventilation time reminder is perfect for wfh office people for the next step, you can compare the time scale data coming from the sensors to automate your ventilation system depending on the length of the sprints or whatever float your boat."
raspberry,"hi all, i have a pool automation system running at home. its basically just an esp8266 that controls relays for the pump, heater and saltwater chlorinator. i have a raspberry pi on my home network running an mqtt server and a nodered server to be able to interface with google home. i also have a cloudbased waterguru device that samples the pool chemicals once a day and sends the data to my account which in turn sends a notification to my phone. what i want to do, is to be able to intercept the data and send it directly to my pool automation system to automatically determine how long the chlorinator needs to be on for to keep the chlorine levels at the desired level. right now, i manually enter in the chlorine levels using a google home control which sends this to my pool automation system which determines how long to keep the chlorinator on for. any ideas how to do this? note, waterguru does not provide any kind of api and does not send an email with the data i need, just a notification to my phone. my first thought was using wireshark but i dont have any experience with this tool so wondering if theres a better way. appreciate any ideas. tia. || sadly, waterguru has removed gh integration || i was curious, and found this so it seems like you can connect waterguru direct to gh, from there you might be able to create a webhook or pull something out of google instead of waterguru. thats what ive done for some things in my home, send it to homekit, build the automation on hk data for nonapi gizmos. itll break down at some point, so i also create a this shit aint working automation for stuff like this. you may also be able to create a webhook that looks at waterguru, but im not sure what the dashboard looks like at all. || intercepting the data from the waterguru device can be a challenge, especially when there is no official api provided by the company. but there are a couple of methods you might want to consider. app reverse engineering it could be possible to reverse engineer the watergurus mobile app to identify the network calls it is making when it fetches your data. you could then try to mimic these calls to fetch the data directly. however, this is a complex task and could potentially violate the apps terms of service. mobile app automation notification reading android provides certain apis that can allow you to read notifications. you can create a simple application that reads the waterguru notification and then sends a request to your pool automation system. this is fairly straightforward, but it does mean you will need to maintain an android device that is always on and has the waterguru app installed. here is a broad overview on how to proceed with the second approach write a small android app which uses the notificationlistenerservice. this service allows you to intercept incoming notifications and read their contents. once you have intercepted a notification from the waterguru app, you can extract the relevant data from the notification text this would be the chemical level information. after you extract the data, you can send this to your mqtt broker. there are libraries available such as paho mqtt that allow you to publish messages to an mqtt broker from android. from there, your nodered flow can take over and adjust the chlorinator settings as required. keep in mind that these suggestions would require a fair bit of software development. its not as simple as using something like wireshark, but without a direct api from waterguru, this kind of workaround may be your best bet. also, you should consider the legal and ethical implications of these methods, as they might breach watergurus terms of service. always consult with a legal professional or seek permission from the company when in doubt."

raspberry,"hi, i was wondering, because somehow i find it very difficult to get proper answers thru google, about iot frameworks for bigger boards. i do have a raspberry pi 1 model b, and was planning to get some zeros too, so basically, not an microcontroller, but also not too powerful. in elixir there is nerves, which supports those boards and comes with a set of libraries for interacting with them gpios, etc, and manages building firmware to burn into an sd card and run your program in your board, plus it can send ota updates to it, so overall a pretty good development experience. that said, elixir is not my favorite language, and i would like to explore other frameworks outside of it. im surprised that i find no equivalent for javascript nor java, given how popular they are, not even python. so well, was just wondering what you people do, or if you are aware of anything similar. thanks! || see the bottom for other languages that use the same firmware."
raspberry,"hi all, completely new in the field here so please bare with me and let me know if this aint the right subreddit for this post! i was thinking to create a system that resembles the og pokedex but i dont know the feasability of it. so basically it needs to be able to scan anything and check if its a pokemon or not, based on that it needs to show an image of said pokemon, play some sound and activate some light and such. this should be no problem for something like a raspberry pi or arduino. but is there a mcu smaller than these that could handle this? thanks for reading this random question! || scan anything is very expensive for a mcu. but something like a rpi pico could scan for shapes or colours. there are already made cameras with built in ml algos going around too. || since you say youre new to the field, the book ai at the edge solving realworld problems with embedded machine learning is great. its quite comprehensive, is pretty beginnerfriendly, and covers several practical indepth examples. as for boards, what youre probably looking for is something with a builtin ml accelerator that can run a deep learning model. if youre just wanting to do classification, you can probably do transfer learning off of mobilenet or efficientnet or something similar. if you want to do multiobject detection and localization, youre probably looking to do transfer learning off of something like yolov8. regardless of the exact model you do, coral dev board micro using the tflite micro framework might be the easiest way to go. not the cheapest option, though. there are several riscv boards with builtin hardware accelerators that would be cheaper, although less documentation and community support most likely. sipeed makes the maix bit and maixduino using the kendryte k210 chip. i have one of them lying around, but i havent gotten around to using it for embedded ml yet its on my todo list. then theres the pine64 ox64, which is like an underpowered rpi zero but with a small ml hardware accelerator. its dirt cheap, too. i also have a couple lying around that ive been meaning to experiment with. i also have a sipeed lichee rv dock which is about equivalent to an rpi zero, and while it doesnt strictly have an ml accelerator on it, it does have a vector extension to its cpu and a builtin digital signal processor, which can be used to accelerate ml workloads. im actually currently working on a side project trying to accelerate a neural network from scratch on this board, so i have better familiarity with it. the ncnn ml framework has some examples running on it, actually, so that might make it not too hard to use. overall though, depending on your technical background, it may be easiest to stick with a more triedandtrue path like with the coral. im actually currently working with the coral usb accelerator at my day job right now, and i know for a fact its not insanely hard to train a computer vision model, convert it to onnx then to tflite, and run it on the edge tpu. it should be similar with the coral dev board micro, except in c instead of python. the other boards are cheaper but less documented and less software support and would likely require more hacking around to get working. feel free to ask me any followup questions if you have any! edit i will add that running machine learning on microcontrollers is a pretty young but rapidly growing field. as such, it hasnt yet really coalesced around standard frameworks or hardware quite yet, although tflite micro might be the most common at the moment. its a fun area, but still quite young and small. if you stick with a project like this, youll learn a lot! not an easy beginner project, but probably doable given enough time. || arduino is many things. arduino uno is definitely not capable of that. arduino nano 33 might be, and the portenta h7 should be able to do it. they are both smaller than the uno if dimensions is all that matters to you."

raspberry,"hi, i am a beginner in this field. looking for advise. i hope you all can assist me on this. i have a project which requires to connect few sensors to iot system and monitor it using mobile apps over gsmgprs module as the area do not have any internet connectivity. the mobile apps also can switch on the relay. so, i have done some google and found out about several key items in iot and this is my current understanding of the items 1. thingsboard iot platform that have multi tenancy and can show sensors data and dashboard. it also have mobile apps. i also have read about openremote. 2. industrial iot iot devices with rugged casing to withstand the environment 3. iot gateway it is required to connect all sensors and gsmgprs module to this gateway so that it can pass the sensor data to a web server. raspberry pi can become iot gateway but for industrial purposes, rather use industrial iot gateway. maybe i am wrong. 4. node red same like thingsboard, but only for dashboard and rule, maybe? 5. mqtt protocol to transmit data from sensor to node red thingsboard, maybe? 6. ionic react software framework to develop custom mobile apps by using react and ionic instead of react native my questions are 1. can i really substitute raspberry pi with an industrial iot gateway? or is my understanding is wrong? 2. is it easier to use thingsboard mobile apps instead of develop custom mobile apps using ionic react? 3. can i use a vps to host a server debianubuntu installed with public accessed node red thingsboard mqtt and receive data from iot gateway sensors gprs module? 4. is my setup and configuration correct? how is it actually to setup my iot system and mobile apps to achieve my goal? thank you for reading my wall of text. i really appreciates your advise in this matter. || there is a lot to breakdown here. let me see if i can answer as best as possible. 1. thingboard attempts to be a onestop shop for all things iot, providing endpoint ingestion, data processing, data storage, data dashboarding visualization, rules and alerts. 2. industrial iot this is a specific implementation of iot for industrial use cases, typically requiring connection to scada systems, historians, noninternet protocols opcua, modbus, rs232, rs422, etc. typically, more secure, and requiring special gateways to connect to the on premises services, and transform harmonize the data into a iot compliant protocol and payload. 3. gateway a gateway is a way to connect sensors and devices to iot services, that might not be able to do it on their own the gateway collects and sends, possibly transforms the data prior to sending if a sensor is a smart sensor it typically can send the data without a gateway. a gateway can often provide edge processing like machine learning prediction, video processing, aggregation of data, rules and notification services without having to send the data to the could for such analytics to take place. 4. nodered programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, apis and online services. nodered can run on the gateway, on the edge, or on the cloud or all three at the same time. it isnt typically a gateway, but rather one part of the services that a gateway provides. 5. mqtt one of a few protocols that iot uses to communicate data. it is two way sendreceive. it is not tied to any specific software, product, or platform. it is open like ftp, telnet and sits alongside http and aqmp as some of the primary protocols to send iot data. 6. iconic react software development framework, not associated with iot. for your questions 1. it is possible for a raspberry pi to be used as an industrial iot gateway, but it typically requires more than just some python code. you could use something like openplc to build out an rpi as an industrial gateway plccontroller. 2. i dont have any direct experience with thingboard, but it looks like a nice platform to start with, as it is an all in one solution. i work for microsoft and we have a apaas platform called iot central. you can set it up in about 1 minute and it has everything you need. here is a walkthrough that you can deploy and start to get data within 5 minutes using your mobile device as the iot device... 3. if you want to use a vm, you will have to deploy, configure, manage, and support all the services you want to use. typically not the best approach. but is an option like thinboard, or azure iot central 4. i dont know what you are attempting to builddeploy, so i dont know if your ideas will support your needs. but i hope i help with my explanation... you can pm me for more info if you need it. || dont get confused by the fancy name of things focus on what is the function you need. for example, you could also use a 3g4g dongle on the raspberry pi or use machine to machine connectivity on the sensors themselves. depending on the country and area where you are 2g may already have been depricated, so make sure to check before deployment. give the details you have provided of your project its too high level to provide more feedback. i would recommend to share a diagram of how each thing should communicate with each other for more helpful advice. || you might want to look at sensaphone instead of trying to roll your own. they work very well and are very reliable."

raspberry,"have a nice day. i am ece student and want to make iot project which i have to do for my bachelors degree thesis. there are some popular ideas on my mind like home, building automation. what are your ideas or opinions about project or projects method? i thought i can use raspberry pi 3 or stm32 with wifi addonthis one is troublesome it would be better if examples or making ways of projects are reachable and kinda realistic for student. ps arduino banned, nodemcu is not banned if its used as only wifi module, already prepared applicationsblynk, thingspeak etc are banned || bachelors degree thesis which school are you going to ?? || it depends on what part of iot you find interesting. but you seem to focus on the sensor actuator part. a lot of iot goes about power management, remote communication and machine2machine communication. also a lot of industries already use automation and machine2machine communication but they dont call it iot. also for the technology stack i would look at something more efficient than wifi. protocols like lorawan, zigbee and ble allow for more efficient communication for remote battery powered sensors. see for instance the use cases for riot os. another thing to think about is where you will send the data and what machine will handle it. be it an edge or cloud computing device. if i were you i would ask if an established industry that now is looking for more remote sensing and automation and look if they have a project for you. i think a lot of businesses see they can benefit from this technology, but they have no clue on how to move forward. because it goes so deep into the business of the company. such an project will have a big theoretical component and probably a first prototype to build they chain. but you will learn a lot from it. || example for a linuxbased device implement basic applicationlevel functionality but implement a fully secure device. from secure boot to runtime linux security. document and share your journey. open source what you end up with, your device configuration and any softwaremodule you add, documentation. this can serve as a template for other people. youll also gain a very valuable and hands on experience on security, which can get you lot of job opportunities."

raspberry,"hi, id like to get started on using lorawan for some home hobby projects, im not very knowledgeable about lorawan, so plz bear with me x200b . i have a esp32, arduino board and raspberry pico lying around, still need to buy a lora board but in most of the guides that i see, they tell you to set up a lorawan gateway as well. this seems rather expensive, and perhaps also a bit overkill if i only have one or two end devices lying around. so, im afraid this is a dumb question, but can i possibly connect to someone elses gateway maybe by paying, and then just pay for for some space on a server? if this is the case, then does someone know of any guides or articles that they can point me towards, so i can have a look at them? || you can use the things network ttn, which is basically open network for lorawan where people setup their gateway and then everyone can use that gateway and network coverage it provides. they state the things network is the first open source, decentralized infrastructure for the internet of things. the community edition is free for fair use. learn how to connect your things! so basically you can setup you own gateway on this platform or use other peoples gw. keep in my if you use other peoples gw you are dependent on the reliability and coverage it provides, cause its free. also check wheter there exists ttn coverage beforehand i encourage you to dig deeper in this and make a detectives work of your own, maybe you can share more details with us about what you found too good luck! || you dont need a commercial gateway, you just need one lora transceiver that talks to your wifi on one end and to your lora nodes on the other end. you could use a for that. || and are similar questions that might help."
raspberry,"hello, this is my first time posting here. i have a college project on making an accident information system, for that i want to connect an impact sensor like to raspberry pi 3b. the problem is everywhere it says, the module is for arduino, but i am working with raspberry pi. my question is can i connect a sensor like this to my raspberry pi. in case its possible, please tell me what wires i can use to connect it. sorry for offending many people if this is a basic question, its my first time building an iot project. || the link you shared is not an impact sensor. its just a mechanical switch. it is not worth anywhere near 169 shown on that page. you shouldnt be paying more than 1 for this thing. its just a switch, with some resistors and an led. i mean, sure, you could use it to detect impacts, but its just a simple momentary switch. what exactly are you trying to do? || you might have better luck in rraspberrypi but my feeling is that would work just fine. it appears to be a simple switch that will complete the circuit when the switch is depressed. giving power to the vccground will supply it with power then having a pickup on another pin connected to out will give you the signal. on the pin connected to out detect if there is power or not when the switch is openclosed. its been too long since i did raspberry pis so i cant tell you which pins would be the best for the pickup. but id imagine you want to go off 3.3v for the power supply side."
raspberry,"most popular hobby boards seem to be the esp series, nrf series, and raspberry pi. why are sts socs not used often in iot projects? || nordic is probably the largest player when it comes to bleenabled commercial devices. so, its not just hobbyists using them. esp32 on the other hand is dead in the water when it comes to commercial battery powered devices theyre a powerhog. however, in the wifi segment, its more scattered esp32 doesnt support anything faster than n not even 5ghz, and in the acax region, there are lots of different vendors. if you need those speeds anyway, you need some powerful mcu and larger flash, too, so youre most likely running an embedded linux or similar. but as a generalpurpose wifi or ethernetenabled, cordpowered lowspeed iot mcu, the esp32 is fairly common in the commercial iot sector. for longrange iot, cellular connectivity is required unless youre going for lorawan, which is a can of worms in terms of patents stabbing you in the back. not to mention, you need to deal not only with a flurry of frequency bands in various parts of the world, you also need to deal with carriers and roaming and god knows what. stm32 has become the intel of embedded mcus theyre basically everywhere, and theres even pin and peripheral compatible clones out there. st really managed to build a portfolio based around their various ip blocks in a very good way, so chances are youve got a handful of them in your home without you knowing it. but, i dont know the cellular market very well, neither do i know how well sts rfcapable mcus compares to other rfcapable mcus. due to all the above works together, the most common usecase in the commercial iot sector is to build a product which combines several different mcus, or rather precertified modules from a third party vendor. for example, a nordicbased blemodule with a gnssgpsmodule from ublox andor cellular modem module. || st chips are used very commonly in iot for larger companies. most industrial applications have a very specific use case and will employ cellular connectivity andor wired like rs485modbus rtu. often the nrf chips and esps are used in hobby projects because they have inbuilt bluetoothwifi and it makes development of consumer type hardware quick and easy with middleware such as zephyros or espidf. it doesnt make sense for larger industrial companies to use a chip with wireless functionality they wont use, as it needs to be certified for emissions testing, has a larger attack surface for security, and costs more, and draws more power. thats my 2c edit and raspberry pis use way too much power for the majority of industrial battery powered iot, and again have a lot of functionality that wont be used"
