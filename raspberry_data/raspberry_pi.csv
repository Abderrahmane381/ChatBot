raspberry pi,"hi! im working on a realworld project involving smart sleeping pods for my place. hostel thing... each pod has 6 beds, and i need help automating things like appbased smart lock door bed occupancy detection using sensors overstay alerts buzzer or light basic monitoring via dashboard or cloud if youre into iot, embedded systems, or have experience with esp32raspberry pi and sensors id love to connect. open to freelance, partnership, or just advice. please dm me or comment if youre interested. thanks! || i am interested || dm me || lets work together"
raspberry pi,"im working on a lowpower, offgrid, bird call audio streaming project using a raspberry pi zero 2 w that collects microphone data from multiple esp32s3 nodes over wifi, compresses the audio, and uploads it to my home computer via a cellular module 4g lte. however, i dont know which cellular module to pick. i only need a 4 mbps upload speed at most, and it must work in the usa, and have relatively low power draw as i will be using a solar setup in the woods. im trying to avoid the relatively expensive 50 cat 4 modulesi dont need that much speed, cost, or power draw. i am not looking for a chip, but a full module. what are your cheapest, usafriendly recommendations? || i have a used couple usb based lte modems, around 25 on amazon with success. but im really interested in your bird listening with esp32s. what does your setup look like if you can share? i was thinking about doing the same around our farm. || i dont have an answer, but i wish you luck on this cool project!"
raspberry pi,"hello reddit, made a quick tutorial on how to install ros2 on the raspberry pi 4 in this video, ill walk you through the full installation process of ros 2 humble on a raspberry pi 4 running ubuntu 22.04.5 jammy 64bit. this setup gives you tier 1 support straight from the ros team perfect for beginners and robotics enthusiasts. if you enjoy iot or robotics content do not forget to subscribe to the channel! thanks, reddit || "
raspberry pi,"hello reddit, recently made a tutorial on how to use hcsr504 pir sensor with the raspberry pi pico w. i think its a cool sensor but can be tricky for beginners first learning how to use it, because they come outside the box incredibly sensitive. i discuss how to fix and incorporate it with a simple example in this video! if you enjoy sensor tutorials do not forget to like, comment and subscribe. appreciate you as always my reddit friends! || "
raspberry pi,"discover the power of lora long range communication with this handson tutorial! in this video, well guide you through building a simple senderreceiver communication system using two raspberry pi pico w boards and lora modules. loras longrange, lowpower capabilities make it ideal for iot applications like smart agriculture, environmental monitoring, and more. you can watch the video here! if you enjoy iot content do not forget to subscribe to the channel! thanks reddit || could your things work with yolink devices?"
raspberry pi,"hi folks, were currently developing a field prototype using a raspberry pi 5 to gather realworld data for an application. im reaching out to the community to get your recommendations on usb wireless network adapters and mobile dongles. wifi dongle we need the capability to attach an external antenna to the dongle. while it doesnt need to support the latest wifi standards, it would be beneficial if it operates on both the 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands. mobile dongle although were based in the uk, our prototype will undergo field testing in kenya. therefore, we require support for the following bands 2g gsm 900 mhz and 1800 mhz 3g umts 2100 mhz 4g lte band 3 1800 mhz, band 20 800 mhz, band 7 2600 mhz were prioritizing reliability and compatibility for these prototypes, but any costeffective solutions would be greatly appreciated as our funding budget is tight. i really appreciate any advice or recommendations you could provide! thanks in advance! || for your wifi dongle, check out this repo there are a lot of options out there, but finding something that is plug and play compatible with an intree linux kernel driver will save a lot of time and hassle. || fyi the majority of cellular dongles requires gui setup which is a pita. look for m2m type dongles which can then be controlled via at commands modemmanager. wifi is easier, you can find stuff there, most likely realtek or mediatek based should work fine. something like rtl88xx based is a decent priceperformance ratio"
raspberry pi,"hello, i want to create a small wifi device with an ai voice api. it will have a button to record audio and another to take photos. there will be no display interface, all communication will happen through audio. here are the components i have in mind microcontroller or microcomputer button for record audio button for taking pictures speaker microphone camera led status indicator rechargeable battery usbc charging cable optional camera flash fisheye lens, a wheel to adjust the volume i was thinking of using an esp32 because its smaller, simpler, and better in terms of battery consumption. however, i realized that esp32 camera modules are only 25mp, and i would like something with higher resolution. so, maybe a raspberry pi would be better to use a higherquality camera, even with a wide lens. at the same time, i think it could get more complicated in terms of development and energy management. what do you think? what would you choose based on this small overview? || i think it all depends on the amount of work you are willing to do, with esp32 you can do all of this and even though the camera is inferior there is a lot of improvement and treatment that you can do, i am a big esp enthusiast and i have read many of these on 4621410111 . based on your project, i believe that you will need more than one esp32 if you choose it, which will consequently not overload any of them at the processing level. i dont know much about raspberry, but it must certainly be simpler due to the processing power and superior modules, if money is not a problem, dont think twice and go for raspberry. || id go with the pi"
raspberry pi,"i did some projects in college with raspberry pi, arduino and microchip microcontrollers. i want to get back into it, what board would you recommend, which one do you use? thanks! || esp32 is pretty good to start with, its cheap. it comes with a nice sdk espidf. it has great connectivity wifi and bluetooth, lots of good documentation and a big community. you can use the ardiuno ide with it, although i dont like it or use it, it makes getting started easy. || it depends. what are the requirements of your project? || checkout walter. walter is an esp32s3 based, open source, module that also has cellular iot ltem and nbiot. the module can be programmed in arduino, espidf, micropython, toitlang and zephyr. you can find all info on and on the discord there is also a growing community."
