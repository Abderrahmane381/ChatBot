78701969,limit switch not responding after keyboard interrupt on raspberry pi gpio,"im working with a limit switch on my raspberry pi 4 running raspbian os. while testing, i interrupted my script with the keyboard, and since then, the gpio pin no longer responds to the limit switch. ive tried gpio pins 16, 20, and 21. they all worked initially and detected the limit switch correctly. however, after interrupting the script on each of these pins, the pi no longer reads the limit switch input. heres my code import rpi.gpio as gpio gpio.setmodegpio.bcm switchpin 16 debouncetimems 200 gpio.setupswitchpin, gpio.in, pullupdowngpio.pudup switchstate gpio.inputswitchpin prevswitchstate switchstate def buttoncallbackchannel global switchstate switchstate gpio.inputswitchpin gpio.addeventdetectswitchpin, gpio.both, callbackbuttoncallback, bouncetimedebouncetimems try while true if switchstate ! prevswitchstate if switchstate gpio.high printquotthe limit switch touched gt untouchedquot else printquotthe limit switch untouched gt touchedquot prevswitchstate switchstate if switchstate gpio.high printquotthe limit switch untouchedquot else printquotthe limit switch touchedquot except keyboardinterrupt gpio.cleanup ive run sudo apt update. using the rpilgpio package after switching from the old gpio package due to edge detection issues. the limit switch is connected from a gnd pin on the pi to the no part of an spdt 250v 5a standard micro switch with lever jaycar, with the gpio pin for data to com. the switch was working fine with this script for hours before the interrupt. ive tested with two separate limit switches and a brand new pi 4. what am i missing here? how can i restore the gpio pins functionality after an interrupt? thanks in advance!",,0,python;automation;raspberry-pi,2024-07-03
