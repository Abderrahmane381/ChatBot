arduino security,"hey folks! ive been working on a project called elatoai it turns an esp32s3 into a realtime ai speech companion using the openai realtime api, arduino websockets, deno edge functions, and a fullstack web interface. you can talk to your own custom ai character, and it responds instantly. last year the project i launched here got a lot of good feedback on creating speechtospeech ai on the esp32. recently i revamped the whole stack, iterated on that feedback and made our project fully opensourceall of the client, hardware, firmware code. demo the problem i couldnt find a resource that helped set up a reliable secure websocket wss ai speech to speech service. while there are several useful texttospeech tts and speechtotext stt repos out there, i believe none gets speechtospeech right. while openai launched an embeddedrepo late last year, it sets up webrtc with espidf. however, its not beginner friendly and doesnt have a server side component for business logic. solution this repo is an attempt at solving the above pains and creating a great speech to speech experience on arduino with secure websockets using edge servers with denosupabase edge functions for global connectivity and low latency. what it does sends your voice audio bytes to a deno edge server. the server then sends it to openais realtime api and gets voice data back the esp32 plays it back through the esp32 using opus compression custom voices, personalities, conversation history, and device management all builtin arduino packages 1. bblanchonarduinojson7.1.0 2. links2004websockets2.4.1 3. 4. 5. esp32asyncespasyncwebserver3.7.6 stack esp32s3 with arduino platformio secure websockets with deno edge functions no servers to manage frontend in next.js hosted on vercel backend with supabase auth db opus audio codec for clarity low bandwidth latency 12s global roundtrip you can spin this up yourself flash the esp32 with platformio arduino ide deploy the web stack configure your openai supabase api key mac address start talking to your ai with humanlike speech this is still a wip im looking for collaborators or testers. would love feedback, ideas, or even bug reports if you try it! thanks! || super interesting, marked to be tested!"
arduino security,"in this project, i have created an iot solution where we accurately measure co2 samples and temperature and humidity samples. temperature, co2, humidity, and light intensity are all important environmental factors that can affect the growth and productivity of plants on an indoor farm. by monitoring and controlling these factors, farmers can create an optimal growing environment that maximizes crop yields and quality. so in my attempt to regulate this problem, i have come up with a co2, temp and humidity monitoring solution. it also helps me to remotely steer my lights to complete the optimal photoperiod of my plants. for the cloud backend and to visualize farm data, i am using bytebeam. bytebeam provides a onestop solution for all my iot needs and helps me monitor and manage devices, send overtheair updates, and visualise device data securely. bytebeam has also recently launched its sdk for arduino. the sdk was very much compatible with my esp32 hardware and it took me very less time to integrate it with my code. with the help of the following guides, i was able to get started with bytebeam. smart indoor farm applications using bytebeam, || "

arduino security,"i have an idea for a little project that i want to do for fun mostly. i have this outdoor security camera that is up high and can only be reached using a ladder. it is also near some floodlights. the problem is that spiders build webs and obstruct the view of the camera. i have been clearing the webs away manually using a long pole, but the spiders work so fast, its a daily chore that i have quickly tired of. so i had this idea to use a servo that just rotates a wire attached to the arm to sweep away webs in front of the camera once every 24 hours. the camera is poe ethernet and there is no other continually powered power source nearby the flood lights are on a switch. i would like to construct a device with a battery, a timer, and the micro servo. ideally, the battery charge would last at least a year, preferably longer. it would all have to be enclosed in a weatherproof enclosure and i envision mounting it on top of the bullet camera. however, im not quite sure where to start. i have found micro servos that can be controlled by arduino and rotated in specific positions. i dont want the wire to ever come to rest in front of the camera. and i dont think that some of the simple timer mechanisms i have seen that can be connected to the micro servo would be able to issue the instructions to rotate a specific amount or to a specific position. so do i need an entire arduino to do this? what are the lowest powered components i should look into purchasing? || why not invest in a cheap solar cell battery to top the charge off while you at it? it wouldnt add much to the cost."
arduino security,"hey everyone. i wrote fetch a few months ago to abstract out the complexities involved in working with http clients like wificlientsecure, etc. so far it has got tremendous feedback from this community. thank you all for your love and support. fetch has upgraded a lot since its first version. notable upgrades are injecting custom headers into requests and making requests async. by async i mean nonblocking, which means instead of waiting for the requests response to come from the server and blocking the rest of your code, fetch now takes a callback, schedules it for future, and returns the response into that callback when it arrives from the server. this is a major accomplishment as i have found no possible way to make async requests on arduino.this makes parallel requesting, in particular, tremendously faster. i hope fetch makes your codes bugfree and lives as simple as it has made mine. thank you again for your love and support! repo link release article || "
arduino security,"hey all, not sure if this is the right place for this, but i figured id give it a shot. i would like to find, or if necessary, create a device that can be set to go off with a chime or alarm of some sort at certain times throughout the day. if that was all that was required, then thered be no problem and i could just get an alarm clock, however i would like for this chime to function when i am not in my home, and i would also like for it to shut off after a short amount of time automatically. the goal is to train my pet to hear the chime and expect food, and use the chime to signal to them that there is food waiting at their automatic feeder along with their seizure medication, that must be administered during the work day without me or my partner needing to be present. we thought of a simple alarm clock, but were unsure if it would shut itself off after going off the first time. this could probably be remedied easily enough with an arduino and a small speaker or something similar but i wanted to look for a prebuilt solution first, and was unsure on how to search for a device like this. i was having a difficult time online, lol while thinking of it a little more, we realized would also like to be able to trigger this alarm manually remotely in case the first chime does not alert our sleeping pet. this new scope is what brought me here, as i am very unfamiliar with wifi communication and smart home type devices. ideally, i would like to be able to control the alarm from my iphone, or through some sort of remote, while many miles away at work or on a day trip. is there any prebuilt or outoftheboxready solution for something like this? we already have amazons blink security cameras, and would plan to use those to monitor whether the chime worked to notify our pet to the presence of food and medicine. the cameras have a live talk feature, which might work as a manual trigger, but we would need to talk into the phone or play some sound wherever we are remotely. this is fine if necessary, but in an office at work, it would be inconvenient to have to step out to trigger the cameras sound aka, essentially call my pet to their food manually with my own voice additionally, this feature must be activated manually, and i was looking more for something that was autonomous, at least until i could check and see that the chime did not wake my pet, and then if needed i could manually activate additional alarms until they come and get it. any advice here? if this is the wrong forum for such a question, please let me know! and maybe guide me to the right place? || there all kinds of pet food dispensers available, diy and commercial. watching videos of the electronics people have diyd for themselves and their pets. once your pet hears the feeder motor running, that will be their alarm. no need to have an extra alarm. ask this question on the arduino subs and you will get a lot of good examples. good luck || check if the cameras integrate with something like home assistant that has the ability to play audio files to remote speakers it may be able to treat the camera like one. that can also do all the scheduling you would need. in fact it integrates with some pet feeders already."
arduino security,"i wish to integrate aws iot and ota updates on esp8266. i am not looking for any solutions but would like to implement it myself. i am okay using some basic libraries like the ones that handle tcp connections and wifi interactions but i want to have full control. so my requirements are 1. secure mqtt connection with client certificates i see i can use wificlientsecure 2. ota usually ota updates work like the program downloads the new firmware and write it to flash and reboots and bootloader boots with the new firmware. thus i might have to make some modifications in bootloader as well. this was what i have discovered till now. i want to understand is this the right path, any better alternatives. i am okay with any complexities involved. not really looking for shortcuts. also if i want to go even lower i.e. not using arduino framework how should i approach that. || "
arduino security,"i belong to the programming field, and i know a few programming languages. i know c, c, java, html, css, javascriptonly frontend, not node.js, php, sql. i have an above beginner level knowledge of these technologies and i can develop android and web applications by myself. i dont have any knowledge of data structures and algorithms. i havent ever worked with any microcontroller. i dont know to use arduino. i have no prior knowledge of sensors. i have very low or almost no knowledge of electronics. i have high school level knowledge in physics and maths. x200b i want to get started with iot and my goal at the least is to be able to develop simple applications of iot that can be used in daily life like app controlled electricity systems for home, an appcontrolled locking system for home security, etc. x200b so with my current knowledge, in which direction should i get started? and as i am not in a college i cant get exposure to a lot of tools, ill have to buy all the sensors and tools that are needed by myself while keeping the cost as low as possible. x200b also, can you provide links to helpful resources that i can use to help myself? x200b thankyou. || a great place to start i have spent countless hours on this site. go through projects and understand them before you buy. they have tons of cheap sensors and microcontroller boards to pick from when you are ready to buy. they also have entire kits that can help. i recommend starting with a simple temp probe to play with. the official arduino site is also very helpful. download the latest ide and go through the reference page and forums. any question you have has almost guaranteed already been asked in the forums. || so many places to start and things to aim for. depends on what youre after... i would say look into an arduinoesp8266 weather project and make an app there if you like that...technologies like c, microcontrollers, mqtt servers, displaying data. or you could go like raspi, learn linux, buy some sensors and connect them all in home assistant and graph them learn from their data, maybe some actuators like lights or switches etc. connect various things in nodered and make a dashboard. you can go hardware or software....working with software or more hardware, frontend backend? sensors data, graphing data, etc. || there are three main parts of iot embedded devices, wireless communications and cloud in embedded devices, its where you will deal with the hardware. here, the easiest was to start is to get an arduino kit. there are plenty in amazon to start working with sensors, leds and stepper motors. you will learn how to code the in the arduino ide based on c and c, which is also part software. then you can use some esp8266, esp32 and other microcontrollers. tip to help with the c syntax, you should download in your phone sololearn, and so a c course, little by little. another option is a raspberry pi, but its more code base, and its not a microcontroller but a microcomputer. in wireless communications, you will have to start learning about the iot communications mqtt, lora, sigfox, nbiot... there are courses in coursera about iot, you can find a course and take it for free. in clouddata processing, if you want to send the data of the sensor to a cloud, you have several options of clouds. you can be as simple as sending this data to a google sheets, thingspeak, the things network, aws, explore the adafruit io, you can send data there and display in a dashboard. if you want to keep the data processing and storage local meaning in your houseplace, you need a raspberry pi. it can run home assistant and nodered as some other people mentioned."
arduino security,"i recently purchased my first arduino board and thought i was buying a wifi adaptor esp12e lmao oops for it, but ended up with two different devices. im fairly new to all of this, so i apologize if i misuse terms! ive been messing with the nodemcu 1.0 and have recently thought of the idea to use it for a smartcontrol for the light switch in my room with a servo motor. i have tested connecting to the device through a web browser and sending it requests and also set up an iphone. my concern is that obviously its not secure to simply go to an ip address in a browser and then fire off a request haha. im in a housing complex where i guarantee many people would screw with me if they knew about this. therefore, im wondering what the safestbest security measure is to achieve this. i was thinking about possibly requiring a password to be able to achieve an action, but still that does not seem secure. is there anyway to make it deviceunique, where my phone is the only device that can control it? also, id like to be able to accesscontrol the board from anywhere not just my lan. what are the proper steps in achieving this? i have a raspberry pi sitting around that i could maybe try to host a web server on? i appreciate any feedbacktips, thank you! || hello, i would recommend looking into blynk. they have authentication for every phone and device, you can use the pi as a server host."
