Aim:
To design and implement two circuits:
A circuit to control the speed of a DC motor using a potentiometer.


A circuit to blink an LED using an Arduino.



Theory:
DC Motor Speed Control with Potentiometer:


A 9V battery powers the motor.


A potentiometer acts as a variable resistor, controlling voltage.


As voltage increases, motor speed increases; as voltage decreases, motor speed decreases.

arduino monitoring,IOT 1.txt,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meganamaddila/LTmegana/main/IOT 1.txt,"To develop a temperature monitoring system, you'll need several components to measure, process, and possibly display or transmit temperature data. Here's a list of essential components for such a system:

Temperature Sensor: This is the primary component that measures the temperature. Common types include:

Thermistor: Changes resistance with temperature.
RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector): Uses the resistance change of metals with temperature.
Thermocouple: Generates a voltage proporti"

The BMP180 is a barometric pressure sensor that can measure altitude, pressure, and temperature. It's commonly used in weather monitoring, altimeters, and navigation systems.

📌 Wiring BMP180 with Arduino
The BMP180 communicates using I2C. Here's how to connect it:

This modification to the Ardupilot UAV firmware allows using a cellular (mobile) phone transceiver to be connected to the APM or PX4, using IP over the mobile network for in-flight MAVLink telemetry.

Earlier solutions would open an TCP/IP connection on the cellular module, and then put it into a data-transparent mode to simulate a hardwired connection. This method was simple but it had several drawbacks:
- Poor performance, because MAVLink messages were"
