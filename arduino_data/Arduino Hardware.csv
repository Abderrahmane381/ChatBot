Arduino Hardware
Arduino has over the years released over 100 hardware products: boards, shields, carriers, kits and other accessories. In this page, you will find an overview of all active Arduino hardware, including the Nano, MKR and Classic families.
Kits
Kits are a great way to get started with Arduino. The classic
Starter Kit
includes an Arduino UNO R3, a large set of electronic components, and a physical book with 15 chapters to help you get started.
The
OplÃ  IoT Kit
includes the components needed to build amazing IoT projects, the
Sensor Kit
includes a variety of sensors and actuators, and the
Plug and Make Kit
includes a set of easy-to-use plug and make nodes that can be combined in any way. These kits also have their own dedicated content platform, with several cool projects to follow step by step.
Nano Family
The Nano Family is a set of boards with a tiny footprint, packed with features. It ranges from the inexpensive, basic Nano Every, to the more feature-packed Nano 33 BLE Sense / Nano RP2040 Connect that has BluetoothÂ® / Wi-FiÂ® radio modules. These boards also have a set of embedded sensors, such as temperature/humidity, pressure, gesture, microphone and more. They can also be programmed with MicroPython and supports Machine Learning.

The MKR Family is a series of boards, shields & carriers that can be combined to create amazing projects without any additional circuitry. Each board is equipped with a radio module (except MKR Zero), that enables Wi-FiÂ®, BluetoothÂ®, LoRaÂ®, SigfoxÂ®, NB-IoT communication. All boards in the family are based on the
low power processor, and are equipped with a crypto chip for secure communication.
The MKR Family shields & carriers are designed to extend the functions of the board: such as environmental sensors, GPS, Ethernet, motor control and RGB matrix.
Boards
Shields
Classic Family
In the Classic Family, you will find boards such as the legendary Arduino UNO and other classics such as the Leonardo & Micro. These boards are considered the backbone of the Arduino project, and have been a success for many years (and more to come).
Boards
Shields
Mega Family
In the Mega family, you will find the boards for the projects that demand lots of computing power and GPIO pins.
