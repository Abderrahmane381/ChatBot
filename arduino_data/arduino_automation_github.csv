arduino automation,Philosophy.txt,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfassler/eFirmata/develop/Philosophy.txt,"- The reasons for eFirmata -

### Number 1:

The number 1 reason why eFirmata exists is because USB cable length 
is limited to about 5 meters.  

I would like to attach arbitrary slave devices (like sensors, motor 
control, lighting control, etc) to my computer at distances greater 
than 5 meters.  I could use multiple hubs, chained together.  But 
each hub adds latency, cost, and a point of failure.  

A good solution would be Arduino+Firmata, using RS-422.  This 
requires custom cabling with "
