arduino automation,"i looking into building a selfhostable supbaselike alternative to arduino cloud. existing iot backends focus more on devicefirmware management, low code automation and storing timeseries data. none of them focus on building apps or services like supabase does. supabase itself has support for timescaledb via a plugin for timeseries data but it lacks many other features such as a message broker mqtt, managing topics and real time dashboards with input widgets. lot of existing options are also not selfhostable except nodered and thingsboard. are any of you out there looking for a new selfhostable iot backend? an iot backend that is more focused on building apps and services like supabase? || this is a really cool idea! ive spent a lot of time working with supabase and have been in the iot space for over 11 years, so i can see how your solution could be super helpful for developers and hobbyists. if youre thinking of starting this as a hobby project, i think its a great fit. on the business side, though, there are a few things to consider. from what ive seen, many companies are willing to pay good money to avoid the headaches of dealing with infrastructure. they like solutions that make their lives easier, meaning you have to maintain the infrastructure for them. also, its really important that your solution can work with the technologies businesses are already using. no company, especially in iot where hardware is involved, wants to take the risk of replacing their entire tech stack with something new. your idea has a lot of potential, especially for the developer and hobbyist crowd. just keep in mind that for businesses, making sure its easy to integrate with what they already have will be key. in my experience with i started by offering infrastructurebackend services to businesses while maintaining it for them. over time, ive been working on the developer platform that adds features to help those with technical backgrounds build products themselves. this approach has allowed me to meet the needs of both business clients and developers. || ive definitely felt the gap when it comes to selfhostable iot backends that focus more on app development and less on just device management. something with the flexibility of supabase but tailored to iot would be awesome, especially if it had builtin mqtt support and realtime dashboards. would love to see what you come up with!"
arduino automation,"hello everyone, so i have a lot of questions. im creating a poultry care and monitoring system. itll have automated feeding, automated water container filling, automated medicine dispensing, live streaming of the chicken coop, environment monitoring and environment control. im using arduino uno to control the entire thing. my question is how can i connect the arduino to a react native app and firebase? i already have an esp8266 wifi module and most tutorials i see online say to use the blynk and arduino cloud but these platforms dont have the full capability to completely support my project. || start small. draw all the elements of the system and think how they cooperate with each other, what they do and why. from what you described i understand that your system is large and distributed because all of the feedingwateringcontrolling devices are not sitting in one place. that means you have multiple for example arduino control boards. they need to send and receive information commands, telemetry, etc to control center. at the same time you want to provide user with access to that info. i think about system like that it is of course simplified arduino boards equipped with wifi modules are operating motors, sensors etc. they communicate with mqtt broker for example mosquitto that is deployed somewhere on a server in internet in cloud in your local network. there is a user interface app mobile or web or both. it is your frontend. it only shows something or receives user input. it uses api provided by backend app deployed on a server in internet or in cloud. backend app communicates with mqtt broker and sends publishreceives consume messages between your frontend app and whatever you have in your poultry. this is the most interesting part, and depending on your requirements backend could address mqtt broker directly or via another integration services. things like firebase, rabbitmq, kafka, caching, storing data, analytics and other stuff can be found here. || since you have what is called ot operational technology it probably relies on relays, plcs, esp32,etc... i would recommend the it site of your iot solution to start using mqtt. you should think about an unified architecture, but for that you start first with the mqtt infrastructure either use emqx tougher good support coreflux easier , reliable but less ui management , web sockets react can connect via web or tcp mosquito easy , a lot of documentation but single thread for the topic structure looking at what you describe you can have a directory of your poultry care. example poultryfeeding machine poultryfeeding machineenabled true poultryfeeding machineactivated false poultryfeeding machinenextcycle 21022024 173225 poultrymedice machine poultrymedice machineenabled true poultrymedice machineactivated false poultrymedice machinedose 15 poultrymedice machinenextcycle 21022024 173225 ..... the ideia is to make an uns that follows the process , then it is easy to make different apps or services . since you can put touch panels, other devices to react to the data of other devices . if the feeding is on in the mqtt you can put the medice machine enabled. i would definitely recommend seeing how the devices could integrate below to automate even more. i bet you will have new ideas, even ml is possible using this . just provide data into an historiandata silo using aggregation and you can make a machine learning algorithm to predict something. you just need to decide what you want fat or big and design the data in a different way. check what is mqtt and an mqtt broker || do you know how to develop this software? what are you trying to do on the app side? you can connect an app, my cofounder is on the software end and we just send data via a simple http push request in json. thats stored and processed in a database with a simple python back end, that pushes to an app created in a nocode builder. but all the parts are interchangeable, so do what you know."
arduino automation,"in this project, i have created an iot solution where we accurately measure co2 samples and temperature and humidity samples. temperature, co2, humidity, and light intensity are all important environmental factors that can affect the growth and productivity of plants on an indoor farm. by monitoring and controlling these factors, farmers can create an optimal growing environment that maximizes crop yields and quality. so in my attempt to regulate this problem, i have come up with a co2, temp and humidity monitoring solution. it also helps me to remotely steer my lights to complete the optimal photoperiod of my plants. for the cloud backend and to visualize farm data, i am using bytebeam. bytebeam provides a onestop solution for all my iot needs and helps me monitor and manage devices, send overtheair updates, and visualise device data securely. bytebeam has also recently launched its sdk for arduino. the sdk was very much compatible with my esp32 hardware and it took me very less time to integrate it with my code. with the help of the following guides, i was able to get started with bytebeam. smart indoor farm applications using bytebeam, || "
arduino automation,"have a nice day. i am ece student and want to make iot project which i have to do for my bachelors degree thesis. there are some popular ideas on my mind like home, building automation. what are your ideas or opinions about project or projects method? i thought i can use raspberry pi 3 or stm32 with wifi addonthis one is troublesome it would be better if examples or making ways of projects are reachable and kinda realistic for student. ps arduino banned, nodemcu is not banned if its used as only wifi module, already prepared applicationsblynk, thingspeak etc are banned || bachelors degree thesis which school are you going to ?? || it depends on what part of iot you find interesting. but you seem to focus on the sensor actuator part. a lot of iot goes about power management, remote communication and machine2machine communication. also a lot of industries already use automation and machine2machine communication but they dont call it iot. also for the technology stack i would look at something more efficient than wifi. protocols like lorawan, zigbee and ble allow for more efficient communication for remote battery powered sensors. see for instance the use cases for riot os. another thing to think about is where you will send the data and what machine will handle it. be it an edge or cloud computing device. if i were you i would ask if an established industry that now is looking for more remote sensing and automation and look if they have a project for you. i think a lot of businesses see they can benefit from this technology, but they have no clue on how to move forward. because it goes so deep into the business of the company. such an project will have a big theoretical component and probably a first prototype to build they chain. but you will learn a lot from it. || example for a linuxbased device implement basic applicationlevel functionality but implement a fully secure device. from secure boot to runtime linux security. document and share your journey. open source what you end up with, your device configuration and any softwaremodule you add, documentation. this can serve as a template for other people. youll also gain a very valuable and hands on experience on security, which can get you lot of job opportunities."
arduino automation,"i want to be an iot developer and make solutions to automate things like tedious tasks or improve efficiency at my factory. my background is in mech eng. ive been pursuing learning about iot for a while now playing with arduino, rpi, aws lambda and dynamo and a small project too machine trackers. any tips on what i should learn next? im so confused as theres so much out there. i was thinking of learning how to create apps. i know its a very tedious and long process so i wanted to ask if it is worth it for an iot developer? or should i focus on something else like learning stm32 microcontroller programming? || ubazoukibarnacle, i have found an error in your post know its a very tedious it was possible for you, bazoukibarnacle, to have typed know its a very tedious instead. its is possessive its means it is or it has. this is an automated bot. i do not intend to shame your mistakes. if you think the errors which i found are incorrect, please contact me through dms! || iot is as vague a term as any invented by the sales people. they are still laughing. so anything connecting to the internet is iot. with that in mind, chose an area that you are interesting in. cell phone connections, lora connections, wifi connections, ble connections pick one and go with it. || learning embedded c on stm32 could be a nice starting point. if you buy an eval or dicovery board they come with a lot of example code and they have comprehensive guides a large community of developers."

arduino automation,"im not a iot guy, im a android developer! im working on home automation. i wanted to connect my arduino with my android app via internet! i cannot use firebase and free hosting sites as a server, since they have read limit, and arduino will constantly request server to read a value. is there any other way to send some integer values to arduino other than i mentioned here? || those are api via reads right? why not just use mqtt? usually the limits for mqtt are much more generous. || for an internetlinked project, consider replacing the arduino with an esp32, or at least augmenting it with one. theres example code out there which accomplishes connecting an esp32 to a cloud mqtt broker with mqttoverssl, which is what youd need to create a reasonably sound system."
arduino automation,"hey guys, i am very happy to share my first iot project. its project. i am able to control lights, fans, music, curtains, ambience with the android app that i developed for it. do check out the video and give reviews. also, suggest any improvement or efficient way to do it if any. || good || nice"
arduino automation,"ive been reading a lot on iot over the last few weeks and across all the research papers ive seen, there seemed to be two recurring topics. 1. the current use cases for iot outside of iiot edge computing are a bit contrived or would be a hard sell to the cities, malls, stadiums, etc where the iot solution would be deployed. additionally, managing the costs and the latency requirements of the implementation would also be difficult. 2. there doesnt seem to be a communication standard that encompasses this experience. theres mqtt, fog computing, ngsi, etc and a few different flavors, but there isnt a de factowinning standard. this is still a new area of interest for me, so i may very well be mistaken ive got a background in web and mobile ios computing and have been playing around with arduinoraspberry pi over the last week and im struggling to come up with meaningful use case. ive built an automated irrigation system and wifi connected led projects to get my feet wet just like everyone else on instructables, but, im still at a loss on how to contribute in a more meaningful way. any suggestions on how to contribute to the iot space as in independent contributor? any intersection between iot and ios where i could contribute? || i think the best way is to get out and talk to people. let them describe their day, follow them around, and see if you can think of anything that would help them. an example a while ago i supported a thesis worker. a local university had been tracking the migration of an endangered fish. they inserted transmitters into fish and put a receiver at a strategic place in the river. the receiver logged timestamps of when each transmitter passed by. after a few weeks they pulled up the receiver and retreived the log from the sd card. he thesis worker connected the receiver to a sigfox transmitter, and transmitted the list of received ids in near real time. a small change, but this made a big difference. the professor could now get email as soon as the migration started, and they could move the receiver upstream multiple times during the migration to get additional data. i have many more examples like this, but they all start with someone working in their field a domain expert talking to someone who understands iot. the domain expert doesnt know what technical solutions exist, and the iot person doesnt know what problems exist, but together they can identify areas of improvement. || the current use cases for iot outside of iiot edge computing are a bit contrived or would be a hard sell to the cities, malls, stadiums, etc where the iot solution would be deployed. additionally, managing the costs and the latency requirements of the implementation would also be difficult. yes, when a new technology comes out, people always opine about the wonderful possibilities without regard for who will pay for that? just like people keep talking about mining resources on the moon to sell on earth. the economics are never going to work, no matter how expensive the resource. that is why every successful technology finds a killer app where someone is willing to pay a lot to solve their problem. i.e. email caused a lot of people to get online. it is rarely the use originally envisioned the web was for sharing technical documents, the telephone was for listening to concerts remotely. only by thinking deeply about the economics, can you predict what will actually be successful. saying cities, malls, stadiums, etc seems like you have been reading too much speculation. people making money in iot right now are selling to factories, homes ring, retail stores, etc. x200b there doesnt seem to be a communication standard that encompasses this experience. yup, and there never will be. even the internet isnt all http nor even all tcp. that reminds me of people complaining about all the different computer languages its not a problem, because we cant settle on one human language either. x200b playing around with arduinoraspberry pi over the last week and im struggling to come up with meaningful use case. yeah, its going to take more than a week. x200b ive built an automated irrigation system and wifi connected led projects to get my feet wet i see what you did there. x200b im still at a loss on how to contribute in a more meaningful way. any suggestions on how to contribute to the iot space as in independent contributor? you are tilting at windmills. that is like saying i just got a cs degree, how can i move the field of computing forward? sorry, but that position requires decades of research. if you want iot to be more than a hobby, youre going to have to make money at it. if you are going to make money, you have to have a customer, and have to be able to solve one of their pressing needs. its that simple. i know a guy who gets paid to put sensors on bridges and hook them up to the cloud because his customer wants early warning about floods. it all starts with the customer and their problem. || iot, although having been around for a long time 10 years, is all around you but the problem is that you only hear about the silly, contrived uses for it. that makes it sound like its a solution looking for a problem, when thats far from the truth. i led a project about 15 years ago at my company to put our very expensive machines online to enable remote diagnostics. in our case, it was very much a problem that needed to be solved, and after we did this, our service costs dropped dramatically average of 1,000day to send a service tech out. they dropped to the point that new customers had to pay higher service fees if they didnt let us put the machines on their network. i honestly dont see any unmet needs here. 15 years ago when we did that project, we had to build everything ourselves because the few providers out there were too expensive and didnt offer the flexibility we needed. today, i can stand up a simple iot monitoring solution in an afternoon if i had to! the businesses who know they need this tend to be able to find solutions because there are many providers already. i think the real problem is that there is little need for it in the consumer space and thats why it looks like a pointless toy to many. industrial and commercial iot is definitely booming but those applications tend to be hidden from view. your electric company probably doesnt need to roll a truck to get your meter readings any more because they can get them remotely, the big hvac rooftop units on top of buildings will call home to their manufacturers when they need service, the number of people enteringleaving a mall or stadium is now known in real time, etc. its big and getting bigger. however, to the end user its seen as a feature in a product, not a product in itself. i.e., when were designing a new machine or system, well get a request to add internetcellular remote monitoring or control to it. its expected as something thats built in, not an external add on."
