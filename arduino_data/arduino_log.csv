arduino log,"is there anyway to remotely collect or see realtime logs like how one would do on a normal backend server deployed on a vm or containers for an arduinoesp32 iot device? ||  || espidf has but im not sure if its accessible in arduino || mhm if its an arduino youd have to send it somewhere else for long term storage, but short term or if its not a lot of bits you can write it to the eeprom and read it with a programmer from the command line. theres also modules i belive for a microsd card, or perhaps a bigger eeprom chip. the options are endless really."
arduino log,"my googlefu is failing me. i want to set up some photo eyes along a production line and log every time they go on and off using mqtt. ideally, id get a batterywifi sensor where all i have to set up is the networking config, the device name mqtt tag and the address of the mqtt broker. a poe device would work too. does anything like that exist? id love to get some photo eyes, temperature sensors, vibration sensors, and rotary encoders with that same setup. for now ive cobbled together a fairly cheap plc and wired up some photo eyes, but i feel there should be an easier solution out there that doesnt require running 120v power everywhere i want to set up a sensor. i may try out a cheaper arduino setup and just keep a drawer full of spares for when they succumb to the elements. the factory floor is hot, dusty, noisy, and bouncy. || id get a batterywifi sensor wifi devices dont work well on batteries, unless you want to charge them every day like your phone. very inconvenient for iot devices. so maybe that is your problem. you probably want a lighter protocol there are hundreds zigbee, bluetooth, ble, matter, thread, ant, lora, lorawan, etc. many of these can last a year on a tiny battery. then you can have a gateway hub that puts them on your network. || look at the exhibitors at embedded world in germany or sensor expo in usa. you are looking for multiple sensors and the combo tends to not exist in one product. for example the camera is made by several logistics vendors like zebra."
arduino log,"i have been using portals to track a few refrigerators at work and log their temperature for a few years now. data is sent through 3 arduinos and a number of ds1820 sensors and dht22s. i have received an email from them, that portals will be discontinued and that people should move to pro accounts. pro accounts are meant for companies providing iot services hence the 150month minimum fee. what would you suggest as an alternative for dashboard and logging? i dont mind paying as long as it is something reasonable for a sole user. by the way, here is the dashboard... || i think adafruit io is another option for that kind of small scale stuff easy to get started and 10month if you want to store more data. || thingspeak is free for noncommercial use and you get up to 4 channels to store data, visualizations, matlab, and email alerts. || i would build this on aws using aws iot core, if youre sending a small amount of data youd be in the free service tier. you can then easily build a dashboard to display data using something like here is a list of dash boarding stuff to look over, including a free selfhosted one here,"
arduino log,"hi, i am from a hardware community called makergram. recently ive been part of a hackathon as a mentor. the hackathon held in kerala, india, you can read the full story from here after the hackathon, we realize that this product has potential and we want to build the solution and spread the world. the solution is to build a river monitoring system to predict flood and river water quality, we completed the prototype using arduino with some basic sensors, next we need to build stable mvp. we are a team of different age group and background and located in different parts of kerala . after discussion with team we concluded network as a cellar and next thing select the best accurate, less expensive sensor. sensor parameters are water level high priority water quality river flowmeter rain gauge discussion log looking for your valuable suggestion on the sensor selection and feedback. thank you. || interesting application. for the water level, probably some sort if ultrasonic distance sendor should work well or a vented pressure sensor. for rain fall, a tipping bucket rain gauge will give you the most accurate data. water quality ones are expensive but have a look at insitu or ponsel sensors. not sure about flow ones, but there are some ultrasonic ones out there if you have deep pockets."
arduino log,"i want to send sensor data from arduinos over mqtt to my linode server. i see plenty of options out there for mqtt brokers mosquitto looks very good and lightweight, but i need some sort of web dashboard, graphing, logging, alerting rules, etc. this is for home use, so expensive isnt an option. i would prefer to host everything on my machine and not rely on other iot servers, but i would not rule that out completely my first take is mosquitto influxdb grafana since i know grafana a bit. wondering if theres something more purposebuilt than that though. or better implementations. thanks. || node red is very popular for this. || thingsboard is what you need. || do you have any programming skills? i can you describe my current setup but it requires a little bit coding background im a professional programmer but iot beginner. ive just setup the following configuration really similar to your first take my sensor based on nodemcu sends data to mqtt broker ive used mosquitto my own ruby script retrieves data from the mqtt broker and saves it to influxdb grafana does its job mqtt broker, ruby script and grafana run on my raspberrypi so far it works just perfect"
arduino log,"hey guys! im really excited to start an iot project for my house, but im lost with all the resources and platforms out there. i want to make a sensor that logs the times at which my door was open. so far, ive uncovered that the easiest way is to use grove sensors and a grove breakout board so that i dont have to solder anything. but my problem is, what do i put on top of it? i want to have it as small and as cheap as possible. ive looked into some arduinos, but im not sure which one is the most indicated. then, i would have it connect to my home wifi and send everything to a database. i already have amazon iot. but how would i achieve this? also, do you guys know of any good introductory course out there or a slack group where iot folks hang out? thanks! || hi endorphins! i just recently launched a project the iot list you can check it out here the website is basically a collection of all the best resources and products related to internet of things. like here find yourself a suitable framework etc. not sure if it will help you, but if it does i hope it helps espen || i work for an called losant. we also sell a that uses an inexpensive arduino compatible wifi microcontroller called the esp8266nodemcu. the kit includes very and provides all the required source code to get you started. you then have free access to the platform to track the data however youd like. || youre doing better than i am i used an old twine and had it tweet every time the door vibrated, which i counted as opening, although a firm knock would get it as well. i then used ifttt to log its tweets to a google sheet. good luck!"
