Initial Setup:

After uploading the code to your ESP32, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
Set the baud rate to 115200.
The ESP32 will attempt to connect to your WiFi network and initialize the SD card. Look for messages in the Serial Monitor indicating the connection status and SD card initialization.

Q1. Why is my LED very dim when I flash it?

A1. Have you used the correct resistor value with the LED?

There are two versions of the Arduino Pro Micro, a 3.3 volt device
and a 5 volt device. The resistor required with any LED will be 
slightly different if the supply voltage is different. A 330 Ohm
resistor is typical with most LEDs on a 3.3 Volt supply.

Also, if you have bought a kit of bits including buttons, note that
there will be higher value resistors (usuall"

Basics learning of API for beginners.

What is API?

API stands for : Application programming interface. It is a means of communication between your application and other applications based on a set of rules.

API security is nothing but securing the API endpoints from attackers. A vulnerable API could lead to:

o Unauthorized Acces

o Unauthenticated Access

o Data leakages

o Sanctioning Fuzzy input

o code & Injection Vulnerabilities

o Parameter Tampering, etc.
