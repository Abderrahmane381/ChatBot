arduino monitoring Zabbix,"hey everyone, quick question, im planning to build a simple weather monitoring station and could use some advice on selecting an arduino board or something similar. i want to measure temperature and humidity from just outside my back door. ive already got a basic setup and power source ready at home. the idea is to have the arduino connect to my home wifi so i can access the sensor readings remotely through a web interface or dashboard. what im looking for is an arduino or compatible board with reliable wifi capabilities something that can easily send data over the internet like mqtt, etc. bonus if it supports libraries or tools for quick web integration i dont know much but ill seen some services like blynk, thingspeak, or even just simple http servers any recommendations on which board to go with? ive looked at the esp8266 and esp32, but im not 100 sure if either is suitable for this kind of small, alwayson outdoor project. appreciate any suggestions! || telemetryharbor.com"

arduino monitoring Zabbix,"hello everyone, this is my first time getting into iot. i am planning to build an air quality monitoring and prediction system using arduinos that act as sensor nodes that send the air quality data to a central esp32 using lora protocol. i want to make an interface that visualizes the current realtime air quality data and the predicted future air quality data. i am confused if i should make it a mobile app or web app. i am leaning towards making it a mobile app with flutter or react native, because i plan to send notifications to users. please enlighten me on what the better choice will be. || neither, i would just use grafana for visuals. || cool idea, why not lorawan though? || grafana or thingsboard or blynk"
arduino monitoring Zabbix,"hello everyone, so i have a lot of questions. im creating a poultry care and monitoring system. itll have automated feeding, automated water container filling, automated medicine dispensing, live streaming of the chicken coop, environment monitoring and environment control. im using arduino uno to control the entire thing. my question is how can i connect the arduino to a react native app and firebase? i already have an esp8266 wifi module and most tutorials i see online say to use the blynk and arduino cloud but these platforms dont have the full capability to completely support my project. || start small. draw all the elements of the system and think how they cooperate with each other, what they do and why. from what you described i understand that your system is large and distributed because all of the feedingwateringcontrolling devices are not sitting in one place. that means you have multiple for example arduino control boards. they need to send and receive information commands, telemetry, etc to control center. at the same time you want to provide user with access to that info. i think about system like that it is of course simplified arduino boards equipped with wifi modules are operating motors, sensors etc. they communicate with mqtt broker for example mosquitto that is deployed somewhere on a server in internet in cloud in your local network. there is a user interface app mobile or web or both. it is your frontend. it only shows something or receives user input. it uses api provided by backend app deployed on a server in internet or in cloud. backend app communicates with mqtt broker and sends publishreceives consume messages between your frontend app and whatever you have in your poultry. this is the most interesting part, and depending on your requirements backend could address mqtt broker directly or via another integration services. things like firebase, rabbitmq, kafka, caching, storing data, analytics and other stuff can be found here. || since you have what is called ot operational technology it probably relies on relays, plcs, esp32,etc... i would recommend the it site of your iot solution to start using mqtt. you should think about an unified architecture, but for that you start first with the mqtt infrastructure either use emqx tougher good support coreflux easier , reliable but less ui management , web sockets react can connect via web or tcp mosquito easy , a lot of documentation but single thread for the topic structure looking at what you describe you can have a directory of your poultry care. example poultryfeeding machine poultryfeeding machineenabled true poultryfeeding machineactivated false poultryfeeding machinenextcycle 21022024 173225 poultrymedice machine poultrymedice machineenabled true poultrymedice machineactivated false poultrymedice machinedose 15 poultrymedice machinenextcycle 21022024 173225 ..... the ideia is to make an uns that follows the process , then it is easy to make different apps or services . since you can put touch panels, other devices to react to the data of other devices . if the feeding is on in the mqtt you can put the medice machine enabled. i would definitely recommend seeing how the devices could integrate below to automate even more. i bet you will have new ideas, even ml is possible using this . just provide data into an historiandata silo using aggregation and you can make a machine learning algorithm to predict something. you just need to decide what you want fat or big and design the data in a different way. check what is mqtt and an mqtt broker || do you know how to develop this software? what are you trying to do on the app side? you can connect an app, my cofounder is on the software end and we just send data via a simple http push request in json. thats stored and processed in a database with a simple python back end, that pushes to an app created in a nocode builder. but all the parts are interchangeable, so do what you know."
arduino monitoring Zabbix,"i have a circuit board that is connecting a esp32c3wroom02n4 to bg95m3. looking into the schematic it looks like the bg95m3 is connected to pin 7 and 6 in esp32 but im not 100 sure. when i use these two pins in the arduino code i get no results in the serial monitor. im not sure what is wrong. i will appreciate if someone can help and suggest any solution! || based on the schematic youve provided, the receive and transmit pins look ok this is a standard configuration for uart communication, where the transmit pin of one device connects to the receive pin of the other, and viceversa. 1. did you check the baud rate defined in your code matches the baud rate of bg95? 2. do you have the correct board support package installed in the arduino ide for the esp32c3 and any required libraries for the bg95 3. check your serial monitors baud rate matches the baud rate youve defined in your arduino code 115200 in this case. 4. try a quick test by just sending an at command to the bg95 and checking if you receive an ok response. this is the most basic test for at commandbased modules."
arduino monitoring Zabbix,"i am doing an air quality monitoring system based on iot. now i need to improve that so that it can use solar energy to run. how can i add solar panels and battery to this system in an efficient way. article || i think your first step is to understand how much power your system requires to operate at different stages, such as while idle,when reading sensors, and transmitting data, etc. with that you can estimate how much energy will be required to run off the battery for few days as to accout for the weather at your location cloudy days, snow, dust, etc . with the energy consumption you can then estimate the size of the solar panel you will use. as you can imagine, the requirements will vary greatly based on your design an operating options. a system that reads and transmits data every 5 minutes and sleeps in between readings will consume far less energy than a system that reads every few seconds for example. i suggest you take a look at videos by andreas spiess on you tube. he has few videos discussing solar power and batteries. nicks blog is also an invaluable source of all things arduino, including battery and solar"
arduino monitoring Zabbix,"hi all, i am working on a project to make a name tag of sorts. the simple idea behind it is a wearable display with color and bluetooth capabilities. i want it to be less then 5 and an internal battery source that is rechargeable important detail i wasnt thinking of when i first started. i have searched for the last few days trying to find the perfect hardware. epaper and eink lack the color i need. i purchased a and an i have written code for my simple display in arduino ide and works fine through bluetooth. problem being the hardware i am using doesnt fit my needs as i lack the skillset to solder a battery, make it rechargeable and enclosed found 3d printed cases i might be able to take advantage of so that the chip is not visible. these esp32 chips seem to be great but i havent been able to find an all in one item. i have looked for things like minitablets that would make this work but no luck. is there any programable display under 5 that includes the features listed above folks have used before? money is not an issue within reason. || is there any programmable display under 5 this says 5 feet, are you sure thats what you meant ?? there are lots of versions available here are a few more suggestions there is nothing a beginner can think of that has not already been done many many times before. good luck || ive just made something with the adafruit clue and their charger. good news is that no soldering is required. bad news is that the clue display is much smaller than you want. || we are currently testing 5 inch display based on esp32s3, its a hmi kind of a product not battery powered. we can build a customized product for you with battery. you can check out our current esp32 based product range on"

arduino monitoring Zabbix,"hi there! ive recently started, with a friend of mine, an air quality monitoring project. i wanted to use a selfhosted grafana instance to get the data from the esps to make a dashboard, with realtime updates, hopefully. ive now successfully wrote some arduino code to get data from the sensor, get the raw sensor data and post it as a json to a server, which then saves it. example of the json sent timestamp70874,deviceid1,temperature19.81573677,pressure1015.01001,altitude 14.72637558,humidity44.55621338,gas57.58499908,dewpoint7.387362906 i will soon implement the proprietary bosch bsec magic to also get an iaq number out of that data. im using a freetier vm from oracle cloud to host grafana and this very basic, proofofconcept python post server. now to the tricky part how do i get that data and make it into a dashboard? ive looked into prometheus and got very confused very fast, so itd be great if someone could point me to the right direction. thanks in advance! || i use a tig stack for that telegraf, influxdb, grafana running on a linux vm with mqtt using mosquitto as a broker as the data transport method. telegraf subscribes to mqtt data and passes the data on to influxdb. then you can use the influxdb database in grafana to display data. || iot platforms are commodity. most offer a freetier. the commercial ones that we can recommend and have experience with losant, ubidots, tagoio. it would take on the order of an hour to do what you want. || i use thingsboard as mqtt broker and it can display metrics 10usmo and it can send data to grafana. and a lot moar"
arduino monitoring Zabbix,"in this project, i have created an iot solution where we accurately measure co2 samples and temperature and humidity samples. temperature, co2, humidity, and light intensity are all important environmental factors that can affect the growth and productivity of plants on an indoor farm. by monitoring and controlling these factors, farmers can create an optimal growing environment that maximizes crop yields and quality. so in my attempt to regulate this problem, i have come up with a co2, temp and humidity monitoring solution. it also helps me to remotely steer my lights to complete the optimal photoperiod of my plants. for the cloud backend and to visualize farm data, i am using bytebeam. bytebeam provides a onestop solution for all my iot needs and helps me monitor and manage devices, send overtheair updates, and visualise device data securely. bytebeam has also recently launched its sdk for arduino. the sdk was very much compatible with my esp32 hardware and it took me very less time to integrate it with my code. with the help of the following guides, i was able to get started with bytebeam. smart indoor farm applications using bytebeam, || "

arduino monitoring Zabbix,"hi, im working on an interactive art project for an event next year. were proposing to create a set of three moving sculptures that respond to triggers from a web application probably post requests sent from twilio. the movements are very simple a motor that rotates part of the sculpture from a start position to an end position. but the sculptures are fairly heavy probably low 100kgs and will need to run outdoors for up to 2 months. the sites for the sculptures will have power but no wired internet connection and will be visible but physically inaccessible to the public. maintenance access to the sculptures will also be limited and attending the site in person would be a significant overhead, so they would ideally run reliably unattended for the 2 months. weve created interactive projects in the past using arduinos to control low powered lighting and digital media players using directly connected switches and sensors. we think we know in principle how wed make this project work see our proposal below. but weve no practical experience of... 1. what are the potential issues of remotely controlling a physically hefty device over networks? 2. what testing and test stages? would be advisable to plan for? 3. what would be good practice for safeties sensors resets remote admin ota to ensure the sculptures dont get stuck or get damaged by the control system. heres our current thinking on the system below. any thoughts, comments or questions gratefully received! thank you in advance! proposal controller arduino we have several unos in our cupboard sensors 2 x magnetic reed switches, for the start and end positions of the sculpture motor switching via a solenoid driver connection gsm module softwarecontrol logic arduino monitors the positionstate of the sculpture using the sensors in start position, end position or unknown arduino keeps an activitystate for the sculpture it is either busy carrying out an instruction or idle if the sculpture is idle but not in the start position it would prompt an instruction to reset it to the start position. web application sends remote instruction to initiate the sculpture moving as a post request directly to the arduino controller? the arduino sets the activitystate to busy and carries out the instruction i.e runs the motor to move to the end position, pauses and then back to the start position. edit corrected a couple of typos... || the only issue i see is connecting an arduino uno to the internet. all the unos i know cannot connect to the internet at all. connecting a modem gsm or similar is ok, but those do not do post requests. id rather have an rpi connecting somehow to the internet plenty choices there and connect the rpi to the uni via a serial interface or usb. the rpi can handle post requests easily and it can talk to the uno via simple commandsbytes via the serial interface devttysx. the other recommendation i have make sure no one can get injured. and that you can put the thing into a known state go back to the reset position regardless in what position it currently is. and add fuses to everything which might burn out, e.g. when the motors stall. || as you seem to understand how to drive any motors or lights, ill not address those. will there be any wifi in range of these sculptures ? will there be a constant movement that needs to be monitored ? i see the biggest problem is this thing getting hacked. what citycountry will this be used in ? sounds like fun, but moving 220 lbs around can be dangerous. || how are you planning to handle this when the connection breaks? we know that wireless connection gets distorted sometimes same like the speed of the internet and this can cause serious issues."

arduino monitoring Zabbix,"hey all, not sure if this is the right place for this, but i figured id give it a shot. i would like to find, or if necessary, create a device that can be set to go off with a chime or alarm of some sort at certain times throughout the day. if that was all that was required, then thered be no problem and i could just get an alarm clock, however i would like for this chime to function when i am not in my home, and i would also like for it to shut off after a short amount of time automatically. the goal is to train my pet to hear the chime and expect food, and use the chime to signal to them that there is food waiting at their automatic feeder along with their seizure medication, that must be administered during the work day without me or my partner needing to be present. we thought of a simple alarm clock, but were unsure if it would shut itself off after going off the first time. this could probably be remedied easily enough with an arduino and a small speaker or something similar but i wanted to look for a prebuilt solution first, and was unsure on how to search for a device like this. i was having a difficult time online, lol while thinking of it a little more, we realized would also like to be able to trigger this alarm manually remotely in case the first chime does not alert our sleeping pet. this new scope is what brought me here, as i am very unfamiliar with wifi communication and smart home type devices. ideally, i would like to be able to control the alarm from my iphone, or through some sort of remote, while many miles away at work or on a day trip. is there any prebuilt or outoftheboxready solution for something like this? we already have amazons blink security cameras, and would plan to use those to monitor whether the chime worked to notify our pet to the presence of food and medicine. the cameras have a live talk feature, which might work as a manual trigger, but we would need to talk into the phone or play some sound wherever we are remotely. this is fine if necessary, but in an office at work, it would be inconvenient to have to step out to trigger the cameras sound aka, essentially call my pet to their food manually with my own voice additionally, this feature must be activated manually, and i was looking more for something that was autonomous, at least until i could check and see that the chime did not wake my pet, and then if needed i could manually activate additional alarms until they come and get it. any advice here? if this is the wrong forum for such a question, please let me know! and maybe guide me to the right place? || there all kinds of pet food dispensers available, diy and commercial. watching videos of the electronics people have diyd for themselves and their pets. once your pet hears the feeder motor running, that will be their alarm. no need to have an extra alarm. ask this question on the arduino subs and you will get a lot of good examples. good luck || check if the cameras integrate with something like home assistant that has the ability to play audio files to remote speakers it may be able to treat the camera like one. that can also do all the scheduling you would need. in fact it integrates with some pet feeders already."
arduino monitoring Zabbix,"id like to share my experiment on how to easily create your own tiny machine learning model and run inferences on a microcontroller to detect the concentration of various gases. i will illustrate the whole process with my example of detecting the concentration of benzene 6h6gt based on the concentration of other recorded compounds. things i used in this project arduino mega 2560, neuton tiny ml software to my mind, such simple solutions may contribute to improving the air pollution problem which now causes serious concerns. in fact, the world health organization estimates that over seven million people die prematurely each year from diseases caused by air pollution. can you imagine that? as such, more and more organizations, responsible for monitoring emissions, need to have effective tools at their disposal to monitor the air quality in a timely way, and tinyml solutions seem to be the best technology for that. they are quite lowenergy and cheap to produce, as well as they dont require a permanent internet connection. i believe these factors will promote the mass implementation of tinyml as a great opportunity to create aibased devices and successfully solve various challenges. therefore, in my experiment, i take the most primitive 8bit mcu to show that even such a device today can have ml models in it. dataset description my dataset contained 5875 rows of hourly averaged responses from an array of oxide chemical sensors that were located on the field in a polluted area in italy, at road level. hourly averaged concentrations for co, nonmetanic hydrocarbons, benzene, total nitrogen oxides nox, and nitrogen dioxide no2 were provided. it is a regression problem. target metric mae mean absolute error. target c6h6gt. attribute informationrh relative humidity ah absolute humidity t temperature in c pt08.s3nox tungsten oxide. hourly averaged sensor response nominally nox targeted pt08.s4no2 tungsten oxide. hourly averaged sensor response nominally no2 targeted pt08.s5o3 indium oxide. hourly averaged sensor response nominally o3 targeted pt08.s1co tin oxide hourly averaged sensor response nominally co targeted cogt true hourly averaged concentration co in mgm3 reference analyzer pt08.s2nmhc titania. hourly averaged sensor response nominally nmhc targeted you can see more details and download the dataset here step 1 model training the model was created and trained with a free tool, neuton tinyml, as i needed a super compact model that would fit into a tiny microcontroller with 8bit precision. i tried to make such a model with the help of tensorflow before, but it was too large to run operations on 8 bit. to train the model, i converted the dataset into a csv file, uploaded it to the platform, and selected the column that should be trained to make predictions. x200b x200b the trained model had the following characteristics the model turned out to be super compact, having only 38 coefficients and 0.234 kb in size! x200b additionally, i created models with tf and tf lite and measured metrics on the same dataset. the comparison speaks louder than words. also, as i said above, tf models still cannot run operations on 8 bits, but it was interesting for me to use just such a primitive device. x200b step 2 embedding into a microcontroller upon completion of training, i downloaded the archive which contained all the necessary files, including metainformation about the model in two formats binary, and hex, calculator, neuton library, and the implementation file. x200b since i couldnt run the experiment in field conditions with real gases, i developed a simple protocol to stream data from a computer. step 3 running inference on the microcontroller i connected a microcontroller on which the prediction was performed to a computer via a serial port, so signals were received in a binary format. the microcontroller was programmed to turn on the red led if the concentration of benzene was exceeded, and the green led if the concentration was within permitted limits. check out the videos below to see how it worked. x200b in this case, the concentration of benzene is within reasonable bounds 15 mgm3. x200b in this case, the concentration of benzene exceeds the limits 15 mgm3. conclusion my example vividly illustrates how everyone can easily use the tinyml approach to create compact but smart devices, even with 8bit precision. im convinced that the low production costs and high efficiency of tinyml open up enormous opportunities for its worldwide implementation. due to the absence of the need to involve technical specialists, in this particular case, even nondata scientists can rapidly build super compact models and locate smart aidriven devices throughout the area to monitor air quality in realtime. to my mind, its really inspiring that such small solutions can help us improve the environmental situation on a global scale! || well explained, thanks"

arduino monitoring Zabbix,"so as a background, recently i have started keeping a ball python and because i live in arizona humidity is often a factor so manual mistingspraying is required to keep up with her care. this worries me if i ever have to do any travelling for about a week or so that would cause me to be away from home. my idea for a fun iot project is the following 1. use an arduino temperature and humidity sensor i was thinking the dht11 or dht22 since it has a smaller delta regarding measurement tolerance to monitor humidity levels in my enclosure and when a humidity reading is measured below a set threshold, the arduino will trip a mistersprayer to increase humidity within the enclosure once again. so it wont read false positive for spraying probably put in a stipulation it cant go off again for at least a couple hours to give things time to adjust. 2. use pythonmost likely using pyqt or a similar library to create an android app gui that will display readings from my humidity and temperature sensor in real time using a wifi module i welcome your recommendations as to a good one to use and give the option to manually trip the sprayermister to activate. 3. additionally, after these tasks have been completed, i would like to add the following capabilities in this order of importance 1. camera live feed of the interior of the enclosure streamed to the app gui. 2. ability to manually control lighting of the enclosure through the app gui, as well as the option to set it to turn off and on at specific times without intervention. the main non software related challenges im currently trying to think through are how to accomplish the mistingwater spraying system and make it physically realizable as well as putting together a list of parts. currently my list includes a new arduino uno, a dht22 module or three, a good wifi moduleesp8266 perhaps?, the misting setup however i can get that to work, enough long cables as needed, etc. x200b im quite excited to start on this, let me know what you guys think! id be glad to hear any recommendationsthoughts that you guys think would be helpful! also be free to suggest additional ways to make things more interesting! || i always get worried about iot for pets. this is a safety critical system and id like, want to jump off a cliff if anything went wrong. the general rule with this kind of thing is not to trust anything big and complicated with the important parts. separate the ui and anything critical. use watchdog timers and make sure it can handle randomly resetting and coming back repeatedly. press the reset button a bunch of times. make sure you dont get a big flood. make sure you handle millis rollover, dont use malloc, etc. be careful with string on a normal arduino. string can cause heap fragmentation. look at the misra reliability guidelines for this. assume the dht22 or the connection to it can fail in any way. it could report 0 or 100 humidity for no reason. i dont really have experience with them in particular, but cheap sensors can do stuff like that. the mist rate should be limited to the min and max rate you would ever reasonably want. switches used to control mister pumps can also fail. you do not want it to fail in the onstate and mist continually! i would use a selfprotected motor driver module from adafruit or the like. arduinos can be semitrusted, but dont rely on a python running on a pi to send the commands. it can select humidity setpoints at most, but the aduino has to ignore anything outside the safe range. remote access can be hacked. make sure that even someone with full access to everything would not have a way to harm the snake. i have friends with snakes but im not familiar with how much of an issue choking hazards and the like are. but in basically any project mechanical stuff is a major challenge. dont trust any breadboards or jumper wires. youll need a very well done soldered circuit, or something based on groveqwiicstemma or one of those other modular systems to be really reliable. to test whether it crashes if theres noise in the wires, you can get an arc lighter. the way we used to check interference is to carefully zap a screwdriver a foot away as an antenna to make emi. i have no idea what happens if you accidentally touch it though.... but if it crashes when a spark happens during bus activity, you have trouble. || skip the uno and just use the esp for everything. look into esp cam. a quick google search returned results for battery mister that you should be able to use."

arduino monitoring Zabbix,"hi, im working in a personal project using lorawan and i have some conceptual doubts and i think you could help me. maybe i am too newbie to have this questions, but i really need your help im using heltec wifi lora32 v1, based on esp32 and having wifi, bluetooth and lorawan capabilities to monitor weather parameters. at this moment i have 2 heltec modules but i plan to buy more to enhance my project maybe v2. supose i have 3 heltec modules h1, h2 and h3. could i use h1 to receive data from h2 and h3 via lorawan and connect h1 to wifi and send data to a server? or do i really need a gateway to serve as an interface of my system and internetserver? see config 1 another question, do you think it is possible with correct programming to have a scheme like config 2 i.e. create a simple mesh network not using meshtastic a thing that i want to avoid because i have preference to work in arduino ide and i think that to use meshtastic i need to work in python. please, tell me if im wrong. sry for my english and again, sorry for my possible ignorance in the subject. thank you all in advance! || without a gateway, you will not have lorawan. but you can build something on top of lora that isnt lorawan. the big downside is that everything will need to be custom built. you can no longer buy any lorawancompatibe device and use it on your network, since you dont have a lorawan network. another downside is that in a lorawan network, you can just add more gateways to get additional coverage. in a custom solution, you would need custom nodes to extend the network coverage. with that said, if you want to go the diy route, take a look at it supports lora radios, and a bunch of cheaper radios if you dont need to go with lora. || a multichannel gateway is 100 pygate wipy gateway software, so the question is kind of moot. but its been done. theres e.g. code nanogateway for the lopy to make it act as a singlechannel gateway. || semtech, chipset company makes separate chips for end nodes and gateways. the main difference being the number of channels. if your application does require multiple nodes to simultaneously send data to the gateway then it might be possible. good luck!"
arduino monitoring Zabbix,"hi everyone! before i start on my problem, i wanted to say that i have spent last 2 days digging through forums and troubleshooting with nothing to write home about and this is kinda like my last resort. so, i am running a simple sketch on my wemos mini procopy through arduino ide that scans for nearby networks, using esp8266wifi.h library. its set to do the scan, list available networks in serial monitor, wait for 5 seconds and repeat. this is where the funny stuff starts it finds a lot of networks that are pretty far away really consistently, but my ssd shows up there maybe once every 1015 scans. that is happening completely randomly believe me, i checked. needless to say, that it isnt possible to connect to my router since it can barely see it from time to time. same with my mobile hotspot. basically the situation is that the wemos sees networks that are further away and have a poor signal but very rarely sees a routerphone that is 50cm away. can someone please suggest something? my router is asus ac750. im using internal antenna on wemos. is the boardantenna simply faulty? is there a way to check that? i have successfully configured a couple of bare esp8266 chips before and using some of them on daily basis, so its not my first time, but this is just something else. i will provide any information necessary if someone is willing to help somehow. thank you! || "
