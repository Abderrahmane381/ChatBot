arduino,"hey folks! ive been working on a project called elatoai it turns an esp32s3 into a realtime ai speech companion using the openai realtime api, arduino websockets, deno edge functions, and a fullstack web interface. you can talk to your own custom ai character, and it responds instantly. last year the project i launched here got a lot of good feedback on creating speechtospeech ai on the esp32. recently i revamped the whole stack, iterated on that feedback and made our project fully opensourceall of the client, hardware, firmware code. demo the problem i couldnt find a resource that helped set up a reliable secure websocket wss ai speech to speech service. while there are several useful texttospeech tts and speechtotext stt repos out there, i believe none gets speechtospeech right. while openai launched an embeddedrepo late last year, it sets up webrtc with espidf. however, its not beginner friendly and doesnt have a server side component for business logic. solution this repo is an attempt at solving the above pains and creating a great speech to speech experience on arduino with secure websockets using edge servers with denosupabase edge functions for global connectivity and low latency. what it does sends your voice audio bytes to a deno edge server. the server then sends it to openais realtime api and gets voice data back the esp32 plays it back through the esp32 using opus compression custom voices, personalities, conversation history, and device management all builtin arduino packages 1. bblanchonarduinojson7.1.0 2. links2004websockets2.4.1 3. 4. 5. esp32asyncespasyncwebserver3.7.6 stack esp32s3 with arduino platformio secure websockets with deno edge functions no servers to manage frontend in next.js hosted on vercel backend with supabase auth db opus audio codec for clarity low bandwidth latency 12s global roundtrip you can spin this up yourself flash the esp32 with platformio arduino ide deploy the web stack configure your openai supabase api key mac address start talking to your ai with humanlike speech this is still a wip im looking for collaborators or testers. would love feedback, ideas, or even bug reports if you try it! thanks! || super interesting, marked to be tested!"
arduino,"hey everyone, quick question, im planning to build a simple weather monitoring station and could use some advice on selecting an arduino board or something similar. i want to measure temperature and humidity from just outside my back door. ive already got a basic setup and power source ready at home. the idea is to have the arduino connect to my home wifi so i can access the sensor readings remotely through a web interface or dashboard. what im looking for is an arduino or compatible board with reliable wifi capabilities something that can easily send data over the internet like mqtt, etc. bonus if it supports libraries or tools for quick web integration i dont know much but ill seen some services like blynk, thingspeak, or even just simple http servers any recommendations on which board to go with? ive looked at the esp8266 and esp32, but im not 100 sure if either is suitable for this kind of small, alwayson outdoor project. appreciate any suggestions! || telemetryharbor.com"
arduino,"i need guidance on wiring the dust sensor, resistor, and capacitor to the arduino uno. i followed a youtube tutorial, but the v0 value is very low, causing the dust concentration result to be negative. however, it still increases significantly when there is dust. i dont know where i went wrong. thank you! || please verify your wiring to the data sheet check that your logic to this sensor is functioning correctly. there is nothing a beginner can ask, that has not already been done many times before"
arduino,"i want to develop a system similar to wii fit plus using an arduino and a pressure sensor. the system should provide realtime feedback through graphical elements, similar to the training sessions and games in wii fit. additionally, i want to upload all collected data to the cloud for later access. im looking for a platform that can integrate these components. ideally, it should allow me to create a gui for realtime feedback while also supporting a unity addon that enables the game to use the arduino and pressure sensor data as a thirdparty controller. what platforms or tools would you recommend for this setup? how should i approach integrating the arduino, cloud storage, and unity for seamless data flow and interaction? any suggestions would be helpful. || "

arduino,"hi guys, currently working on school iot project and using the arduino uno r4 wifi board. i am also using the blynk iot software for low code purposes for my arduino, however a problem i habe encountered is that my lcd i2c display doesnt work with it anything after blynk.begin will not display anything. may i ask if there are any solutions to this? any help is greatly appreciated. || need to see your code. post your code on any one of the free sites online. can not see your computer screen from here."
arduino,"hi everyone, im working on a project where i want to use the quectel ec200u module for the following tasks 1. receive and parse sms messages. 2. send data to a server through cellular data not wifi. 3. receive data back from the server. 4. control peripherals like buttons and speakers. essentially, im trying to build something similar to a soundbox that reads sms messages aloud. after some research, i found that the quectel ec200u can be programmed with an arduino or esp32, but ive also seen that its possible to program the ec200u directly without these. this confuses me a bit. does it mean i dont need a separate microcontroller like esp32 for my final pcb design? for testing, i was considering starting with the sim800l, but i wont use that for the productionready version of my pcb since i need better functionality and futureproofing. im pretty new to this a noob, haha, so id love your advice on what approach i should follow. should i focus on programming the ec200u directly, or is using it with a microcontroller like esp32 better? any guidance, resources, or insights would be appreciated! || "
arduino,"hi all, im completely new to building these things. my manager gave me couple of esp32s and asked me to make a temperature sensor that sends an email alert if temp is high. now i have no idea all these things work and youtube as well as other guides havent been helpful either. i have downloaded arduino and was able to make light on esp32thing go on and off. but that is all i could do. here is all i have got. 1 x sparkfun esp32wroom thing plus c 1 x espressif esp23wroomda 1 x adafruit ht16k33 1 x battery 1 x temp sensor 2 x breadboards and lots of connecting wires. see photos below for more info i basically need guidance on how to connect them all and like get started. i can do the coding myself. its just that i am not able to make the connections properly. || not sure what sensor you have there. but this seems like a super simple project id look into getting a perma proto board to make things official after bread boarding. again, i cant speak to your sensor but an i2c sensor like the bme280 will be 3v3 vcc, your gpio of choice sig, gnd gnd. youll want to find a library for whatever flavor youre working with, if its well documented that shouldnt be a problem. now, the battery stuff is a bit more tricky but youll want something like a tp4057 to charge the lipo. if you stick a max1704x in the middle you can read the battery level as well. that battery setup will allow you to power directly and charge, power from battery when unplugged. add an on off switch in there to. with all of that in place youll have the basics to power, read temp. now, if this is something that can run on your local network, thats probably the easiest route to monitor youll just setup a webpage that displays the readings hosted on the mcu. if you need something like aws iot thats a bit more involved. feel free to send a dm but this would take like two hours tops to throw together. ps, i saw this dudes board a while ago. i dont have one but it has a lot of what youre looking for baked in || the temperature sensor is a threewire probe, possibly ds18b20. library support should be good whatever environment you use. weirdly, the hardest part might be sending the email, which is probably going to need a thirdparty service provider, which in turn means that someone has to manage that account, and possibly top up tokens and so on. for my personal stuff i just ended up using discord webhooks as it was simpler, has fewer external dependencies, and multiple channels make it easier to manage. slack also looks to be an option similar api."
arduino,"just started getting into this. bought an arduino uno board for like 30 but seems like the pi pico which is only 8 dollars does the same thing? did i get ripped off or is there a difference. || there is a difference. arduino is a fine place to start. if you feel buyers remorse, take it back. but every journey starts with the first step, and you wont understand the differences between these things until you get hands on. || buying an arduino for 30 says you bought an original arduino. you can get an arduino uno clone for 6 from china. just because you did not do your research does not mean you were ripped off. || the ardunio uno r3 is much older, slower and has far less ram. but.. it has a larger board which increases costs but makes it compatible with arduino hats it has a socket for the cpu, which jacks up the cost but lets you replace it, not that you ever will it takes a wide range of voltages increases cost, but also flexability for example, you can run it off a 9v battery or 4 aas its 5v, which many older sensors require and most rgb leds so neither is better, and 20 isnt a ripoff. but i would say the pico is a far better bargain if you dont know what you need."
arduino,"i did some projects in college with raspberry pi, arduino and microchip microcontrollers. i want to get back into it, what board would you recommend, which one do you use? thanks! || esp32 is pretty good to start with, its cheap. it comes with a nice sdk espidf. it has great connectivity wifi and bluetooth, lots of good documentation and a big community. you can use the ardiuno ide with it, although i dont like it or use it, it makes getting started easy. || it depends. what are the requirements of your project? || checkout walter. walter is an esp32s3 based, open source, module that also has cellular iot ltem and nbiot. the module can be programmed in arduino, espidf, micropython, toitlang and zephyr. you can find all info on and on the discord there is also a growing community."

arduino,"i am a complete beginner in anything hardware. im a software developer. my company however is asking me to build a wearable camera. theyre willing to get me any components i need. it should have a camera on the front and a camera on the back. it needs to combine these two videos into a single 350 deg video and stream stream this feed to a server. i did some research on cameras and micro controllers. i have a few questions 1. what protocol should i use for streaming the video? 1.1. internally from the camera to the processor 1.2. over the internet. from the processor to a server. i noticed that a lot of camera systems use rtsp to stream video. its that a good idea for this use case? 2. if i use 2 fisheye cameras, will it be possible to stitch them together on the processor before streaming to a server 3. what processor should i use for prototyping? raspberry pi, arduino or anything else like that i am very new to all this we might need to add more processing functionality in the future. something like basic object detection that runs in the same processor. || good luck. im a hardware engineer with a heap of experience and this sounds daunting even to me! you might have more luck posting over on rembedded for the hardwareprocessing input on stuff. || such an interesting problem to solve for a software developer. id be thrilled if this was given to me. for the 3 point you will have to use raspberry pi or other alternatives of same processing power. arduino will not be able to handle this much processing . on rpi you will be able to use ffmpeg to do video processing. || just buy an insta 360 youre a bit late to the party"
arduino,"im thinking of adding some remote control to a couple of gates in the property opening, closing and checking the state, basically and i was wondering if anyone could help me get started in the right direction on what kind of devices i could use to do that. the gates already have eletric motors and remote controls but i want to be able to control them and see their state remotely not just from a few meters away... im ok with general electronics and ive also played with arduinos and raspberrys so a more diy solution would be ok. my doubts are more towards the connectivity of the devices to the networkweb. ive never done much iot itself so i dont know whats being used nowadays... || id break this down into 3 parts gate control state tracking communication for gate control, depending on how standard the remote controls are, you can just solder some leads to the button pads and use gpio pins on raspi or esp32 to easily control them. youll have to replace the battery unless you wire up some kind of permanent power source to the battery connectors on the remote. for state tracking, outdoorrated limit switches or contact switches would work well here. you dont want to rely purely on software state, cause what happens if the gate gets stuck halfway through? these can easily be wired to more gpio pins. some might need to be i2c and there are expansion boards for that. communication depends on if your wifi can reach the gates or not. if not, use one of the iot data providers. then its a matter of coding up the state transitions, think state machine pattern, for gate transitions. then send that to either one of the iot platforms or your own server. you can also look into using something from homeassistant, either hardware that integrates with it or write your code to integrate with it. || i would not rely on wifi if these gate are for security. wifi hacking is to easy. cell phone comm is much more secure. good luck || heres my .02. fair warning! i work with limited budget! i originally designed a mailbox alert project based on arduino nano using cheap radio frequency transmitterreceiver modules. that worked great on the workbench but was very unreliable between workbench and mailbox. the design evolved to using an esp07 3. it has an esp8266 and builtin wifi that can use either an onboard antenna or an external antenna. i use an external antenna mounted outside the metal mailbox and the device easily connects to my home network from the mailbox. i have another esp8266based project connected to my garage door, which is probably similar to what you are doing. its got a relay in parallel with the normal garage door button so it can open and close the door. it also detects when the door is opening and sends an mqtt message to my mission control microcontroller based on esp32. mission control does various things, such as announcing the door opening on our alexa and warning if the door is open for too long i do have my senior moments. in addition, i created a shortcut on my iphone so i can ask siri to open and close the door. everything works using mqtt and various free or inexpensive cloud services that mostly use rest apis. side note i set up a guest network on my router with client isolation to keep devices from hacking each other. the microcontrollers dont connect to each other directly its all through an mqtt server in the cloud. so beware, if the network is out which is very rare for me, they are dead in the water. actually they dont die any data coming in is cached in a littlefs file until the network comes back up. i currently use a particle photon p2 to monitor my septic panel and have had an excellent experience, unlike mmanulis. imho they have excellent tools and great documentation online. im considering buying a particle boron. it has a builtin cell phone circuit and includes free cell service and are currently on sale for about 30. that avoids the issue of my cable internet going down as it uses cell service to access the internet and can therefore send notifications reliably."

arduino,"im looking to get something like a pendant or a bracelet with a single button, that when pressed would send out a notification or a call to pre programmed contacts. ive seen something like this, but they are only available in some regions and usually come with subscriptions and their own call centers that handle those emergencies. what i would assume i would need is a button that can be programmed to send out a signal to some base station that then could be programmed to send messages or calls. this device would be for my grandmother, shes alright but im being preemptive, she walks her dog daily so the system would need to have some range to it. im not sure what type of signal could carry good enough range, maybe like lora or something like that? and for base station, what would i need? something like an arduino or even raspberry pi? any suggestions would be nice. im not too experienced with stuff like this, maybe some of you have made a system that would work in such a way? || to be honest, i wouldnt be considering relying on a home built safety critical system. i dont believe that it would be reliable enough. commercial systems have quality certification, and when you pay for a 247365 call centre you get 247365 peace of mind. || hello! have you considered using ble and using a mobile phone app as gateway? of course, it is just a valid solution if your mom has a mobile phone and always brings it, but it could ensure the connectivity while she walks her dog. || there are multiple base station button systems available. the only affordable way weve seen to get the range youre talking about is to go with a phone based architecture. get a ble button or badge, connect via bt to ap on phone. gps and cell connectivity from the phone. there are 911 emergency response apis though not free. we recently did a commercial system like this thats used by election poll workers, health care, courts law, and for all kinds of remote work with the public, etc. doing it on a commercial basis with reasonable security can get complex, but for your nan, easier."

arduino,"context our seniors from the previous year created a prototype that controls an outlet socket to turn on or off using a custom application that they made, it also reads the kwh readingusing a current sensorof any appliance that uses the socket. the application and the prototype is connected via hotspot or something, it was never really explained to us in detail, but for it to be controlled wirelessly, we need a phone with the app that sends commands to a laptop then sends it to the nodemcu. now our seniors graduated and the project was passed on to us. we want to innovate their prototype by enhancing the connection features of the device, so instead of a hotspot connectionwhich is very limited by distance we want it to be able to connect to the internet so we can control it anywhere, the problem is we dont know how to do it. we found that the blynk app is very easy to use and is suited with what we want to do, but being students, we have almost little to no knowledge of codingpersonally i have been exposed to coding here and there during the summer, game development and web developmentbut its still hard for me. idea we want the prototype to control the socket 1 and 2 to turn on and off using the blynk app and also display the kwh reading of the each of the current sensor in their respective sockets the node mcu will connect to my wifi and blynk using aunthentication token the node mcu will be the intermediary so that the blynk and arduino could communicate with each other. the blynk app will have 2 buttons and two current display, for socket 1 and socket 2 when i press the button for socket 1, i want the relay 3 and 4 to turn the socket off when i press the button for socket 2, i want the relay 1 and 2 to turn the socket off the blynk app will send data to the node mcu such as the state of the buttons, etc. then the node mcu will tell that to the arduino then the arduino will command the relays accordingly. about the current sensor part, the arduino will do the calculations and read the current sensor, then it will send the data to the node mcu , then the node mcu will send that data to the blynk app to display it. i carefully instructed chatgpt to create the code for me, here is the result, could you guys review it please?? nodemcu arduino mega these are the pin connections in case you need it arduino mega 2560 pin2 in1 relay 1 pln3 in2 relay 2 pin4 in3 relay 3 pin5 in4 relay 4 a2 out current sensor 1 a0 out current sensor 2 gnd pcb board rx1 pin 19 gpio1 nodemcu tx1 pin 18 gpio3 nodemcu nodemcu gpio1 rx1 pin 19, arduino gpio3 tx1 pin 18, arduino gnd pcb board vin pcb board gnd pcb board 4channel relay module relay 1 com pcb board relay 1 no gnd current sensor 2 relay 2 com socket 2 current flow into the socket relay 2 no power source current flow into the relay relay 3 com socket 1 current flow into the socket relay 3 no power source current flow into the relay relay 4 com pcb board relay 4 no gnd current sensor 1 current sensor 1 ucc pcb board out a2 arduino gnd relay 4 no current in socket 1 current from socket to sensor current out power supply current from sensor to power supply current sensor 2 ucc pcb board out a0 arduino gnd relay 1 no current in socket 2 current from socket to sensor current out power supply current from sensor to power supply power supply the setup is powered through a duplex outlet connected to a wall socket using two distinct adapters for the pcb and arduino. || why are you using chatgpt? why are you using google drive for code? you need to start your prototyping with doing one small thing with a single device and build the next thing from there. also you are working with mains voltage which is very dangerous and i dont recommend it unless you know exactly what you are doing. || i have this project due in order to get my engineering degree can you review? || no"

arduino,"hi all, just getting started with iot and need some advice. i want to put some smart lights in my house that are independent from the internet. no need for voice control but want to create a local ittt style network. i.e. if switch is triggered or i use an app then light turns on. i can easily do this with arduino and relay for the light but i would like to use commercial rgb bulbs if possible. that way i dont have to rewire the lights in my house. i am able to write flutter apps. so, is this possible? what should i be looking at for a stand alone setup? any advice? many thanks || most common solution is to use"
arduino,"hello, i hope this post is ok in this subreddit since its a little bit promotional of a product i designed. though, i genuinely think it might be helpful to some, particularly those planning to make lipoliion solar powered projects and want extensive power management and monitoring features. i in resp32, its called the last month it was finally available for purchase. since then ive been working on a demo web app that lets users explore some of the features of esp32s3 powerfeather, which i recently got to a decent state the web app is served from the esp32s3 powerfeather acting as an ap and is accessed from the tablets web browser. the part encircled in yellow shows the battery being charged at 1.5 a from the solar panel at the set mpp voltage of around 12 v. the web app also displays other supply battery telemetry information as well as some power management controls which are all builtin into the board and accessed using the for those interested in the demo web app, maybe to try it on their powerfeather or just to see how this was created || this is pretty rad, nice job!"
arduino,"im working on a networkconnected sauna solution. 1. the main board has an atmega328p and mcp23017 for expansion 2 pins for i2c oled, 4 input buttons for menu controls via oled, 4 temphumudity sensor inputs, 5 relay outputs for heaters, 1 door sensor input and a few for different rgb leds 2. i want the board to be modular so some saunas can be standalone without the networking board, and they work with just an atmega and screen full manual controls 3. as an addon i want to create a web ui for the client, so they can adjust the temperature, humudity, lights etc. i was thinking of adding a rpi for this, since the atmega is very limited with eeprom i would use mqttrest to sendreceive messages between the two devices. 4. i would gladly just keep the arduino as a rest api, host the web ui somewhere else and just plug in the data but most saunas will be off the grid, so i need to host it onpremise, and i really dont want to stick a server in their house just for this. open to any suggestions recommendations, since i havent worked much in this field || thats going to be some tough environment! naturally, every single component that is located on the inside of the sauna must be automotive grade 125 c and above, and you have to enclose it in an ip65graded enclosure with sealed holes for cabling. theoretically ip44 would be sufficient, depending on where it may be mounted. you will need to consider ce emc and red directives. the latter is compatible with fcc, so you might want to focus on that. due to the environment, the radio will become tricky the timing crystals are sensitive to temperature, so you need to get those right. my guess, the yearly production volume will be less than 10k, so the total development cost roughly 0.2m 0.5m will affect the total cost more than the bom cost. you will want to make as easy as possible and then some to install. bracket holder screwed on the wall, then snapon the device. || when you say arduino, do you mean an 8bit arduino ? or do you mean an espxxx device ?? 8bit arduinos do not have any iot capability without extra hardware. if your going to add an rpi, will this rpi be next to the arduino in the equipment bay? if so, what is the arduino for if you have an rpi there ?? do you have experience with high ac voltage circuits ?? do you have experience with ac contact noise in digital circuits ?? yes, this can be done with an 8bit arduino. if you understand all the ramifications. good luck || hi ,ive reviewed your ideas, and your sauna solution sounds very innovative. with regards to your concept, you aim to enhance the overall sauna experience for users through iot technology. given the high temperature and humidity conditions in sauna rooms, the requirements for sensors are quite demanding. therefore, you need sensors that are more suitable to meet your usage requirements. theres still much effort required to turn this idea into a valuable solution. im the product manager at milesight. and light controllers, that can meet the integration needs of this solution. additionally, we recently launched the which can help you quickly integrate devices using openapis to facilitate device integration and better construct the webgui. im interested in discussing your ideas in detail rather than simply recommending our companys products. were particularly interested in developers like yourself with innovative ideas. if youd like to further communicate with me, please feel free to send me an email at , or leave a message here, and ill check regularly. thank you."
arduino,"ive spend hours searching yesterday and today, but apart from one and a lot of versions that use a raspberry pi, im coming up empty. im looking to make a battery powered device that takes the data from nearby zigbee sensors and transmits detections over lora. i want this because an off the shelf zigbee motion sensor is 10 and can even be picked up from places like ikea. an off the shelf lora motion sensor is 60 and is harder to pick up. building my own sensor straight to lora would require a lot more soldering and time. the concept makes sense in my head, yet it doesnt seem to exist or as something that can easily be created. is there anybody who has done something like this? or has a good resource for it? i know about the espressif espzigbeesdk and the is probably a good starting point for people who are fluent in c. i however am not. i write node and python and can write some arduino code, but i feel like getting lora added to this example would make me drown thoughts or advice? || you might consider a board based on the nrf52840 the from seeedstudio is a popular one. it supports zigbee natively, so you wouldnt need a separate zigbee radio, just a lora chip. it can also be programmed using circuitpython or arduino or zephyr, and its a lot more powerefficient than the esp32."
arduino,"so we have to make an iot project for the university. x200b my team decided to make a device that measures the air quality in a room and gives you notifications on the phone or a buzzer when something is wrong and you have an interface on the phone where you can even see the numbers x200b the idea is that the people from univer want us to use drones for the iot project and like putting an air quality on the drone doesnt seem very useful x200b what could i use the drone for, what could i do with it? context the drone is small and can only carry a camera and a microcontroller with some sensors arduino, raspberry py || make it fly around a room and try and detect a gas leak || you could simply have it fly straight up at a pace that allows it to sample the air column. that would be interesting data to see. it could do that over a grid to give a 3d representation of the entire air column which is more interesting. || does it have to measure air quality or is the main project to take the drone and add a sensor?"
arduino,"hello everyone, so i have a lot of questions. im creating a poultry care and monitoring system. itll have automated feeding, automated water container filling, automated medicine dispensing, live streaming of the chicken coop, environment monitoring and environment control. im using arduino uno to control the entire thing. my question is how can i connect the arduino to a react native app and firebase? i already have an esp8266 wifi module and most tutorials i see online say to use the blynk and arduino cloud but these platforms dont have the full capability to completely support my project. || start small. draw all the elements of the system and think how they cooperate with each other, what they do and why. from what you described i understand that your system is large and distributed because all of the feedingwateringcontrolling devices are not sitting in one place. that means you have multiple for example arduino control boards. they need to send and receive information commands, telemetry, etc to control center. at the same time you want to provide user with access to that info. i think about system like that it is of course simplified arduino boards equipped with wifi modules are operating motors, sensors etc. they communicate with mqtt broker for example mosquitto that is deployed somewhere on a server in internet in cloud in your local network. there is a user interface app mobile or web or both. it is your frontend. it only shows something or receives user input. it uses api provided by backend app deployed on a server in internet or in cloud. backend app communicates with mqtt broker and sends publishreceives consume messages between your frontend app and whatever you have in your poultry. this is the most interesting part, and depending on your requirements backend could address mqtt broker directly or via another integration services. things like firebase, rabbitmq, kafka, caching, storing data, analytics and other stuff can be found here. || since you have what is called ot operational technology it probably relies on relays, plcs, esp32,etc... i would recommend the it site of your iot solution to start using mqtt. you should think about an unified architecture, but for that you start first with the mqtt infrastructure either use emqx tougher good support coreflux easier , reliable but less ui management , web sockets react can connect via web or tcp mosquito easy , a lot of documentation but single thread for the topic structure looking at what you describe you can have a directory of your poultry care. example poultryfeeding machine poultryfeeding machineenabled true poultryfeeding machineactivated false poultryfeeding machinenextcycle 21022024 173225 poultrymedice machine poultrymedice machineenabled true poultrymedice machineactivated false poultrymedice machinedose 15 poultrymedice machinenextcycle 21022024 173225 ..... the ideia is to make an uns that follows the process , then it is easy to make different apps or services . since you can put touch panels, other devices to react to the data of other devices . if the feeding is on in the mqtt you can put the medice machine enabled. i would definitely recommend seeing how the devices could integrate below to automate even more. i bet you will have new ideas, even ml is possible using this . just provide data into an historiandata silo using aggregation and you can make a machine learning algorithm to predict something. you just need to decide what you want fat or big and design the data in a different way. check what is mqtt and an mqtt broker || do you know how to develop this software? what are you trying to do on the app side? you can connect an app, my cofounder is on the software end and we just send data via a simple http push request in json. thats stored and processed in a database with a simple python back end, that pushes to an app created in a nocode builder. but all the parts are interchangeable, so do what you know."
arduino,"my googlefu is failing me. i want to set up some photo eyes along a production line and log every time they go on and off using mqtt. ideally, id get a batterywifi sensor where all i have to set up is the networking config, the device name mqtt tag and the address of the mqtt broker. a poe device would work too. does anything like that exist? id love to get some photo eyes, temperature sensors, vibration sensors, and rotary encoders with that same setup. for now ive cobbled together a fairly cheap plc and wired up some photo eyes, but i feel there should be an easier solution out there that doesnt require running 120v power everywhere i want to set up a sensor. i may try out a cheaper arduino setup and just keep a drawer full of spares for when they succumb to the elements. the factory floor is hot, dusty, noisy, and bouncy. || id get a batterywifi sensor wifi devices dont work well on batteries, unless you want to charge them every day like your phone. very inconvenient for iot devices. so maybe that is your problem. you probably want a lighter protocol there are hundreds zigbee, bluetooth, ble, matter, thread, ant, lora, lorawan, etc. many of these can last a year on a tiny battery. then you can have a gateway hub that puts them on your network. || look at the exhibitors at embedded world in germany or sensor expo in usa. you are looking for multiple sensors and the combo tends to not exist in one product. for example the camera is made by several logistics vendors like zebra."

arduino,"hey guys this is my first time stepping into iot. i was suggested a gps tracker as a project and on the first look it looked simple but now im getting overwhelmed with everything. the software part i plan to handle with google iot core or aws thatll be the easy part i think for the hardware the first thing that came to my mind was to get a gsm800 module, a gps module and an arduino nano then i found out esp32 exists and is better than arduino now the esp has wifi so it is enough for a proof of concept as it can talk to the server. but i thought when im investing some time why not do it right then i found out that the gsm module only supports 2g networks that are being phased out and world has moved on to nbiot and ltem ok. so where do i get nbiot sim i found hologram.io there was a company called onomonado offering a software sim whatever the hell that is if anyone has any idea about them do share anywho with my new sim now i need a compatible module and the one i could find on amazon was around 5000 60 in comparison the 2g thing was only 5 now im in a dilemma whether i order the 2g module and try to find a working 2g sim here or go out of my way to shell out extra cash for the nbiot module beside these problems anything i make this way will be bulky compared to the options on the market and expensive too. to get the size down ill have to design my own pcbs like i saw in a few youtube videos what do i do here || im going to assume youre building this for fun learning and not an actual product. also, im going to ignore pcb design as i dont have experience with that. assuming you just want to have a device that reads its gps coordinates and uploads them to a server, i would start by breaking down the project into its components and prove out each component first. sounds like this is your first iot project, so step one is to figure out which board youre going to use. looks like you want an esp32based option. then figure out if you want to use it baremetal, an rtos, micro python, etc. aws iot core and gcp iot core are based on an rtos, you sure you need that level of complexity? can you make it work with arduino ide or micro python first and then sort out something more complex, like an rtos? next figure out how to integrate the gps module. depending on which one you choose and your rtos vs something else above, find a library that supports it. yes, you can write one yourself and it is a fun project, but choose your rabbit holes carefully here. once you got the gps module working, get it talking to your server via wifi, just so you have that sorted out and have an understanding of what that looks like. by now, you have a good understanding of your tooling, libraries, some hardware options, potential issues you can run into when uploading data to the server, etc. you can start looking at lte connectivity options. plenty of external modems out there, hologram sells one. pick one for development purposes first, that way you can sort out your firmware and make sure you have logic to handle the various failure modes of cellular connectivity. oh, make sure there is library support for whatever youre doing. last note, again, assuming youre doing this for learning, id do this with a raspi first, just to limit the number of things i have to learn out of the gate. its not hard to translate that knowledge into something like an esp32 or arduino boards and its less stuff you learn. || modem choice is really nb as different devices use different ran technologies 2g3g4g5gnbiotltemcatm etc and these frequencies are dependent on geographical region and the local mobile network operator. in africa 2g is prolific and nbiot almost non existent. in australia they have phased out 2g."

arduino,"i have built many projects based on the now unavailable pycom gpy. this was basically the only small form factor iot board that was affordable, had wifi, ble, ltem and nbiot and had the certifications required to use it in commercial products. as pycom made the gpy eol without alternative i decided to build a form factor and pin compatible successor, which i call walter. i upgraded the esp32 to an esp32s3, the sequans monarch to the monarch 2 and changed the led with usbc for direct programming. i also added various other improvements such as a hardware modem reset line, software controllable 3.3v out, removed reserved io, ... i also opted for an open source approach and you can find all schematics on github. of course, you can program it in arduino with the well known espressif arduino core. but i have also written an extensive open source arduino library to control the modem. this makes cellular integration very easy. me and my team also created a micropython and espidf modem library which are also open source. also the language has created a library walter is now in the test lab to get his certifications ce, fcc, newzealand an australia. the fact that we made it open source was recognized by crowd supply and i hope you subscribe and share if you like my project. for the development kits connectivity i have chosen to work with soracom which is a global sim card provider. of course there is no obligation to work with them and you can use any sim card you want with walter. yesterday i gave a joint seminar with them and you can watch it on demand through their website x200b || any easy way to do an ota update without bluecherry using arduino ide? i couldnt find any examples using waltermodem.h for ota firmware updates. we wont have wifi connections, and hope to update without resetting the eprom. thanks || have you done power measurements when comms are active and in deep sleep mode? im working on nrf9160 as a weekend project"

arduino,"i am doing an air quality monitoring system based on iot. now i need to improve that so that it can use solar energy to run. how can i add solar panels and battery to this system in an efficient way. article || i think your first step is to understand how much power your system requires to operate at different stages, such as while idle,when reading sensors, and transmitting data, etc. with that you can estimate how much energy will be required to run off the battery for few days as to accout for the weather at your location cloudy days, snow, dust, etc . with the energy consumption you can then estimate the size of the solar panel you will use. as you can imagine, the requirements will vary greatly based on your design an operating options. a system that reads and transmits data every 5 minutes and sleeps in between readings will consume far less energy than a system that reads every few seconds for example. i suggest you take a look at videos by andreas spiess on you tube. he has few videos discussing solar power and batteries. nicks blog is also an invaluable source of all things arduino, including battery and solar"

arduino,"hi all, i am working on a project to make a name tag of sorts. the simple idea behind it is a wearable display with color and bluetooth capabilities. i want it to be less then 5 and an internal battery source that is rechargeable important detail i wasnt thinking of when i first started. i have searched for the last few days trying to find the perfect hardware. epaper and eink lack the color i need. i purchased a and an i have written code for my simple display in arduino ide and works fine through bluetooth. problem being the hardware i am using doesnt fit my needs as i lack the skillset to solder a battery, make it rechargeable and enclosed found 3d printed cases i might be able to take advantage of so that the chip is not visible. these esp32 chips seem to be great but i havent been able to find an all in one item. i have looked for things like minitablets that would make this work but no luck. is there any programable display under 5 that includes the features listed above folks have used before? money is not an issue within reason. || is there any programmable display under 5 this says 5 feet, are you sure thats what you meant ?? there are lots of versions available here are a few more suggestions there is nothing a beginner can think of that has not already been done many many times before. good luck || ive just made something with the adafruit clue and their charger. good news is that no soldering is required. bad news is that the clue display is much smaller than you want. || we are currently testing 5 inch display based on esp32s3, its a hmi kind of a product not battery powered. we can build a customized product for you with battery. you can check out our current esp32 based product range on"
arduino,"i understand this is a big ask, especially for someone like myself who is only just getting started in this world creating things myself. but i just dont know where i should start. i have seen some documentation and forums saying that i cannot do what i want with only an arduino while others seem to say i can... and as someone new to this, i am hoping someone can point me in the right direction. background i live in one of several apartment complexes that have been built over the past few years that are very close to train crossings. yes, i and other residents were well aware of the trains before moving in several years ago, but the promise of train whistle cessation from the city before, during, and after construction has been ongoing and has yet to happen. the city, understandably, needs to improve safeguards around the crossings before they can have trains completely stop their whistles at those crosses, which are right by these apartments. these trains go at all hours, and are, as federally mandated, incredibly loud when they use their horns. while i can sleep through these mostly now, to prove a point, i would like to attempt to build something to detect and record these horns. i have an beginnerintermediate understanding of python, programming logicframework, and iot from consumer. i am hoping to create a deviceprogram that can listen for train horn noises only so as not to also pickup traffic, helicopters, sirens, etc. optional record the horn sound measure the decibels, which can be in excess of 100, at my apartments location formulate that data into a twitter post, with the timedecibel and optionally the sound recording of the horn x200b if anyone can clarify for me the devices i should be looking into, so i can rule out research into a certain area that would be fruitless, i would be truly grateful. || i think the most complex part will be classifying whether it is a train horn or other noise. youll probably need to buffer quite a few seconds of samples and periodically apply fft or a similar transform and perhaps use a machine learning technique, all while continuing to record in the background. this sounds ambitious for arduino. id probably start with a raspberry pi so that cpu constraints would be less of an issue. || 1. buy a microphone that you will use for the final system and begin recording 247. make a note of the time every time you hear a train horn. 2. learn about using tensorflow for classifying audio. 3. train your model against the audio recordings that you have. you will have to manually say what is and isnt a train horn. 4. deploy your system and then automatically classify what is and isnt a train horn the difficult part is that your microphone will be in one spot which will be a varying distance from the train horn. so the db measured by your microphone wont be that meaningful except to record how the horns are affecting you as an individual. || maybe the first place to start would be to make a recording eg on phone and try writing code on a pc to analysedetect horn. ideally the recording would have some horns and also some nonhorn sounds. same if you want to detect trains by images."
arduino,"hello riot! i was wondering if anyone had any tips on designing an iot devices hardware. i was originally going to just use a prebuilt microcontroller like the rp pico or the arduino nano, but then realized i could just create my own board. i dont know where to start, and was wondering if you guys had any tips. || start with a microcontroller unless you are an electronic engineer, but if you were, youd know where to start! jumping from 0 to a pcb is a great way to set money on fire building trash. id suggest you start with an arduino kit, something with a dht1122 and follow a tutorial. start with blink move on to sensors via serial, then add connectivity via a library of some kind i like thingspeak a lot and its free for hobbyist levels with a robust community. once you have a sense of what you want to do and a foundational skillset, id look on tindie diy hardware site to see if the thing you want to build is already built. also, youll get little help in this sub. go to arduino subreddits or stack exchange for specific questions. good luck! here is a fun starter kit || you could use and might even prefer using the same microcrontrollers as are in arduino designs atmelmicrochip at series mostly. then you could prototype on arduinos and later make your own board design once the software and hardware design is done. put another way, the microcontroller chip on an arduino board does pretty much everything of the arduino. the rest is a voltage regulator, a few leds, connectors and possible usb chip integrated in some microcontrollers and possible battery charger etc. so you could still use the many resources available for arduino, including ide, device drivers, tutorials etc when making your own optimized pcb. || i suggest you start with a nodemcu and esphome. the nodemcu provides a usb interface and power supply. esphome supports many sensors. youtube and google should provide all you need to know and take it from there."

arduino,"hi all, completely new in the field here so please bare with me and let me know if this aint the right subreddit for this post! i was thinking to create a system that resembles the og pokedex but i dont know the feasability of it. so basically it needs to be able to scan anything and check if its a pokemon or not, based on that it needs to show an image of said pokemon, play some sound and activate some light and such. this should be no problem for something like a raspberry pi or arduino. but is there a mcu smaller than these that could handle this? thanks for reading this random question! || scan anything is very expensive for a mcu. but something like a rpi pico could scan for shapes or colours. there are already made cameras with built in ml algos going around too. || since you say youre new to the field, the book ai at the edge solving realworld problems with embedded machine learning is great. its quite comprehensive, is pretty beginnerfriendly, and covers several practical indepth examples. as for boards, what youre probably looking for is something with a builtin ml accelerator that can run a deep learning model. if youre just wanting to do classification, you can probably do transfer learning off of mobilenet or efficientnet or something similar. if you want to do multiobject detection and localization, youre probably looking to do transfer learning off of something like yolov8. regardless of the exact model you do, coral dev board micro using the tflite micro framework might be the easiest way to go. not the cheapest option, though. there are several riscv boards with builtin hardware accelerators that would be cheaper, although less documentation and community support most likely. sipeed makes the maix bit and maixduino using the kendryte k210 chip. i have one of them lying around, but i havent gotten around to using it for embedded ml yet its on my todo list. then theres the pine64 ox64, which is like an underpowered rpi zero but with a small ml hardware accelerator. its dirt cheap, too. i also have a couple lying around that ive been meaning to experiment with. i also have a sipeed lichee rv dock which is about equivalent to an rpi zero, and while it doesnt strictly have an ml accelerator on it, it does have a vector extension to its cpu and a builtin digital signal processor, which can be used to accelerate ml workloads. im actually currently working on a side project trying to accelerate a neural network from scratch on this board, so i have better familiarity with it. the ncnn ml framework has some examples running on it, actually, so that might make it not too hard to use. overall though, depending on your technical background, it may be easiest to stick with a more triedandtrue path like with the coral. im actually currently working with the coral usb accelerator at my day job right now, and i know for a fact its not insanely hard to train a computer vision model, convert it to onnx then to tflite, and run it on the edge tpu. it should be similar with the coral dev board micro, except in c instead of python. the other boards are cheaper but less documented and less software support and would likely require more hacking around to get working. feel free to ask me any followup questions if you have any! edit i will add that running machine learning on microcontrollers is a pretty young but rapidly growing field. as such, it hasnt yet really coalesced around standard frameworks or hardware quite yet, although tflite micro might be the most common at the moment. its a fun area, but still quite young and small. if you stick with a project like this, youll learn a lot! not an easy beginner project, but probably doable given enough time. || arduino is many things. arduino uno is definitely not capable of that. arduino nano 33 might be, and the portenta h7 should be able to do it. they are both smaller than the uno if dimensions is all that matters to you."

arduino,"hello everyone. i am new to the world of microcontrollers. i am using a nodemcu board with an esp32 to try to do some projects. i wanted to know what you recommend to start with, i was looking for a complete tutorial but i couldnt find something that convinced me. i am interested more than anything to know the setup os should i program on windows or linux? im a linux user but i saw that most people use windows for this. is it easier on windows? ideframework i generally use vscode. i saw that you can use arduino ide and also espidf. from what i saw vscode with platformio is a good option. any suggestions? tutorial if you know any complete course or tutorial that goes from 0 to some basic project ex using the leds, or using some gpio i would be grateful if you could pass it on to me. sorry for the beginners question but im kind of lost with this topic. also, if you think i should post the question in another sub, let me know and ill change it. || edit formatting came out wrong. if youre programming on a linux box, you need to grant rights to the serial port sudo usermod a g dialout username if you want the easiest way to program, use the arduino ide. vscode and platformio is better, but more difficult to get up and running with. if youre already used to vscode, then installing platformio and the board defs for the esp32 probably wont be a stretch for you. for starting a project, it helps to know what you want to do with your esp32. for example, i have one right next to me on my desk a ttgo tdisplay thats connected to a bme280 sensor and shows the temp, humidity and barometric pressure on its onboard color tft display. it also connects to wifi and reports this data to my linux box over mqtt, so i can visualize it in grafana. i have another one that can subscribe to mqtt data and display it on an ili9341 color lcd. and another one that ive been programming to use as a touchscreen remote for my home theater system. || if youre a linux user, stick with it. everything is worse in windows seriously, though, youre much less likely to have serial driver issues on linux. i think most people use windows because most people have windows, but the number of posts from people with windowsrelated problems is high. platformio is an excellent build system. i use its cli, so i cant comment on vscode. if youre comfortable with it, thats great, or you can likely use the editor of your choice. id take platformio over the arduino ide any day, even if im building arduino code. id suggest that you pick a very simple project to start with, something that interests you. more like blink an led or read the air temperature than build an aicontrolled drone, and work from there. there are a ton of esp32 tutorials online you can find one that works for you with a specific small project in mind. or check out adafruit or sparkfun they both sell many cpu, sensor and controller boards and both have good tutorials adafruit in particular invests a lot in excellent tutorials. if you prefer a higher level language, you can run micropython on a regular esp32, and circuitpython on esp32s2 and s3 boards those models have native usb support, which circuitpython requires. you might check out resp32 for more help. good luck, have fun! || if youre building a device to work with home assistant or to perform any type of automation tasks such as making a thermostat or rgb controler etc then program using esphome. its amazing!"

arduino,"hi, im working on an interactive art project for an event next year. were proposing to create a set of three moving sculptures that respond to triggers from a web application probably post requests sent from twilio. the movements are very simple a motor that rotates part of the sculpture from a start position to an end position. but the sculptures are fairly heavy probably low 100kgs and will need to run outdoors for up to 2 months. the sites for the sculptures will have power but no wired internet connection and will be visible but physically inaccessible to the public. maintenance access to the sculptures will also be limited and attending the site in person would be a significant overhead, so they would ideally run reliably unattended for the 2 months. weve created interactive projects in the past using arduinos to control low powered lighting and digital media players using directly connected switches and sensors. we think we know in principle how wed make this project work see our proposal below. but weve no practical experience of... 1. what are the potential issues of remotely controlling a physically hefty device over networks? 2. what testing and test stages? would be advisable to plan for? 3. what would be good practice for safeties sensors resets remote admin ota to ensure the sculptures dont get stuck or get damaged by the control system. heres our current thinking on the system below. any thoughts, comments or questions gratefully received! thank you in advance! proposal controller arduino we have several unos in our cupboard sensors 2 x magnetic reed switches, for the start and end positions of the sculpture motor switching via a solenoid driver connection gsm module softwarecontrol logic arduino monitors the positionstate of the sculpture using the sensors in start position, end position or unknown arduino keeps an activitystate for the sculpture it is either busy carrying out an instruction or idle if the sculpture is idle but not in the start position it would prompt an instruction to reset it to the start position. web application sends remote instruction to initiate the sculpture moving as a post request directly to the arduino controller? the arduino sets the activitystate to busy and carries out the instruction i.e runs the motor to move to the end position, pauses and then back to the start position. edit corrected a couple of typos... || the only issue i see is connecting an arduino uno to the internet. all the unos i know cannot connect to the internet at all. connecting a modem gsm or similar is ok, but those do not do post requests. id rather have an rpi connecting somehow to the internet plenty choices there and connect the rpi to the uni via a serial interface or usb. the rpi can handle post requests easily and it can talk to the uno via simple commandsbytes via the serial interface devttysx. the other recommendation i have make sure no one can get injured. and that you can put the thing into a known state go back to the reset position regardless in what position it currently is. and add fuses to everything which might burn out, e.g. when the motors stall. || as you seem to understand how to drive any motors or lights, ill not address those. will there be any wifi in range of these sculptures ? will there be a constant movement that needs to be monitored ? i see the biggest problem is this thing getting hacked. what citycountry will this be used in ? sounds like fun, but moving 220 lbs around can be dangerous. || how are you planning to handle this when the connection breaks? we know that wireless connection gets distorted sometimes same like the speed of the internet and this can cause serious issues."
arduino,"hi everyone. i have built a working prototype of my project using arduinos and nrf24l01 modules. now im thinking if there is any way to make it smaller and more efficient using more modern boards. essentially, i would like to find a device that satisfies the following requirements footprint not larger than arduino nano supports wireless communication similar to nrf24l01. specifically, i need 1mbps speed with typical latency below 5ms. with nrf24l01, i can achieve latency below 2ms even below 1ms, if we dont account for my custom ack messages for reliability. can pretend to be a usb hid device specifically, usb midi. currently, im using arduino micro pro with tttapacontrolsurface library. has uart txrx pins ideally, it should be compatible enough with arduino to support most of its libraries i prefer using platform.io, btw has decent availability aliexpress or european electronics stores community support a quick search usually leads me to esp32 and nrf52832, nrf5340, but most often those are mentioned in the context of bluetoothwifienabled devices. unfortunately, bluetooth will not work for my purpose ble latency can be too large, reaching 20ms. there are lots of boards and modules from cdebyte on aliexpress, and also seeed xiao ble but i have no idea yet which of those boards support raw 1mbps communication and usb hid roles it seems, esp32 does not without buying additional nrf5xspecific programmers and loading softdevices on them. a micro pro or any native usb board with builtin nrf52832 configured to raw communication and not ble would be perfect, but somehow i cannot find anything like that. ill really appreciate any suggestions. || i dont really understand what you mean by raw 1mbps communication, you also mention wifi? the esp32 has wifi and bluetooth, but doesnt support usb hid. just because a module also contains bluetooth in addition to wifi doesnt mean you cant use it. just disable the bluetooth."

arduino,"i have an idea for a little project that i want to do for fun mostly. i have this outdoor security camera that is up high and can only be reached using a ladder. it is also near some floodlights. the problem is that spiders build webs and obstruct the view of the camera. i have been clearing the webs away manually using a long pole, but the spiders work so fast, its a daily chore that i have quickly tired of. so i had this idea to use a servo that just rotates a wire attached to the arm to sweep away webs in front of the camera once every 24 hours. the camera is poe ethernet and there is no other continually powered power source nearby the flood lights are on a switch. i would like to construct a device with a battery, a timer, and the micro servo. ideally, the battery charge would last at least a year, preferably longer. it would all have to be enclosed in a weatherproof enclosure and i envision mounting it on top of the bullet camera. however, im not quite sure where to start. i have found micro servos that can be controlled by arduino and rotated in specific positions. i dont want the wire to ever come to rest in front of the camera. and i dont think that some of the simple timer mechanisms i have seen that can be connected to the micro servo would be able to issue the instructions to rotate a specific amount or to a specific position. so do i need an entire arduino to do this? what are the lowest powered components i should look into purchasing? || why not invest in a cheap solar cell battery to top the charge off while you at it? it wouldnt add much to the cost."

arduino,"hey everyone. i wrote fetch a few months ago to abstract out the complexities involved in working with http clients like wificlientsecure, etc. so far it has got tremendous feedback from this community. thank you all for your love and support. fetch has upgraded a lot since its first version. notable upgrades are injecting custom headers into requests and making requests async. by async i mean nonblocking, which means instead of waiting for the requests response to come from the server and blocking the rest of your code, fetch now takes a callback, schedules it for future, and returns the response into that callback when it arrives from the server. this is a major accomplishment as i have found no possible way to make async requests on arduino.this makes parallel requesting, in particular, tremendously faster. i hope fetch makes your codes bugfree and lives as simple as it has made mine. thank you again for your love and support! repo link release article || "

arduino,"hey all, not sure if this is the right place for this, but i figured id give it a shot. i would like to find, or if necessary, create a device that can be set to go off with a chime or alarm of some sort at certain times throughout the day. if that was all that was required, then thered be no problem and i could just get an alarm clock, however i would like for this chime to function when i am not in my home, and i would also like for it to shut off after a short amount of time automatically. the goal is to train my pet to hear the chime and expect food, and use the chime to signal to them that there is food waiting at their automatic feeder along with their seizure medication, that must be administered during the work day without me or my partner needing to be present. we thought of a simple alarm clock, but were unsure if it would shut itself off after going off the first time. this could probably be remedied easily enough with an arduino and a small speaker or something similar but i wanted to look for a prebuilt solution first, and was unsure on how to search for a device like this. i was having a difficult time online, lol while thinking of it a little more, we realized would also like to be able to trigger this alarm manually remotely in case the first chime does not alert our sleeping pet. this new scope is what brought me here, as i am very unfamiliar with wifi communication and smart home type devices. ideally, i would like to be able to control the alarm from my iphone, or through some sort of remote, while many miles away at work or on a day trip. is there any prebuilt or outoftheboxready solution for something like this? we already have amazons blink security cameras, and would plan to use those to monitor whether the chime worked to notify our pet to the presence of food and medicine. the cameras have a live talk feature, which might work as a manual trigger, but we would need to talk into the phone or play some sound wherever we are remotely. this is fine if necessary, but in an office at work, it would be inconvenient to have to step out to trigger the cameras sound aka, essentially call my pet to their food manually with my own voice additionally, this feature must be activated manually, and i was looking more for something that was autonomous, at least until i could check and see that the chime did not wake my pet, and then if needed i could manually activate additional alarms until they come and get it. any advice here? if this is the wrong forum for such a question, please let me know! and maybe guide me to the right place? || there all kinds of pet food dispensers available, diy and commercial. watching videos of the electronics people have diyd for themselves and their pets. once your pet hears the feeder motor running, that will be their alarm. no need to have an extra alarm. ask this question on the arduino subs and you will get a lot of good examples. good luck || check if the cameras integrate with something like home assistant that has the ability to play audio files to remote speakers it may be able to treat the camera like one. that can also do all the scheduling you would need. in fact it integrates with some pet feeders already."

arduino,"id like to share my experiment on how to easily create your own tiny machine learning model and run inferences on a microcontroller to detect the concentration of various gases. i will illustrate the whole process with my example of detecting the concentration of benzene 6h6gt based on the concentration of other recorded compounds. things i used in this project arduino mega 2560, neuton tiny ml software to my mind, such simple solutions may contribute to improving the air pollution problem which now causes serious concerns. in fact, the world health organization estimates that over seven million people die prematurely each year from diseases caused by air pollution. can you imagine that? as such, more and more organizations, responsible for monitoring emissions, need to have effective tools at their disposal to monitor the air quality in a timely way, and tinyml solutions seem to be the best technology for that. they are quite lowenergy and cheap to produce, as well as they dont require a permanent internet connection. i believe these factors will promote the mass implementation of tinyml as a great opportunity to create aibased devices and successfully solve various challenges. therefore, in my experiment, i take the most primitive 8bit mcu to show that even such a device today can have ml models in it. dataset description my dataset contained 5875 rows of hourly averaged responses from an array of oxide chemical sensors that were located on the field in a polluted area in italy, at road level. hourly averaged concentrations for co, nonmetanic hydrocarbons, benzene, total nitrogen oxides nox, and nitrogen dioxide no2 were provided. it is a regression problem. target metric mae mean absolute error. target c6h6gt. attribute informationrh relative humidity ah absolute humidity t temperature in c pt08.s3nox tungsten oxide. hourly averaged sensor response nominally nox targeted pt08.s4no2 tungsten oxide. hourly averaged sensor response nominally no2 targeted pt08.s5o3 indium oxide. hourly averaged sensor response nominally o3 targeted pt08.s1co tin oxide hourly averaged sensor response nominally co targeted cogt true hourly averaged concentration co in mgm3 reference analyzer pt08.s2nmhc titania. hourly averaged sensor response nominally nmhc targeted you can see more details and download the dataset here step 1 model training the model was created and trained with a free tool, neuton tinyml, as i needed a super compact model that would fit into a tiny microcontroller with 8bit precision. i tried to make such a model with the help of tensorflow before, but it was too large to run operations on 8 bit. to train the model, i converted the dataset into a csv file, uploaded it to the platform, and selected the column that should be trained to make predictions. x200b x200b the trained model had the following characteristics the model turned out to be super compact, having only 38 coefficients and 0.234 kb in size! x200b additionally, i created models with tf and tf lite and measured metrics on the same dataset. the comparison speaks louder than words. also, as i said above, tf models still cannot run operations on 8 bits, but it was interesting for me to use just such a primitive device. x200b step 2 embedding into a microcontroller upon completion of training, i downloaded the archive which contained all the necessary files, including metainformation about the model in two formats binary, and hex, calculator, neuton library, and the implementation file. x200b since i couldnt run the experiment in field conditions with real gases, i developed a simple protocol to stream data from a computer. step 3 running inference on the microcontroller i connected a microcontroller on which the prediction was performed to a computer via a serial port, so signals were received in a binary format. the microcontroller was programmed to turn on the red led if the concentration of benzene was exceeded, and the green led if the concentration was within permitted limits. check out the videos below to see how it worked. x200b in this case, the concentration of benzene is within reasonable bounds 15 mgm3. x200b in this case, the concentration of benzene exceeds the limits 15 mgm3. conclusion my example vividly illustrates how everyone can easily use the tinyml approach to create compact but smart devices, even with 8bit precision. im convinced that the low production costs and high efficiency of tinyml open up enormous opportunities for its worldwide implementation. due to the absence of the need to involve technical specialists, in this particular case, even nondata scientists can rapidly build super compact models and locate smart aidriven devices throughout the area to monitor air quality in realtime. to my mind, its really inspiring that such small solutions can help us improve the environmental situation on a global scale! || well explained, thanks"
arduino,"software neuton tinyml hardware arduino nicla sense me less than half a year ago, a new arduinos board, nicla sense me motion environment, hit the market. and, needless to say, i couldnt wait for a chance to try this brand new device and explore its capabilities. x200b nicla sense me is currently the smallest board across the entire arduino pro family of boards for industrial applications. it comes with a range of bosch sensortec smart motion and environmental sensors, and im quite sure that this device will be widely applicable in industrial iot, as its great for various research projects and commercial use. just have a look at its unique characteristics x200b im really excited about the pace of development of the tinyml field because such small devices coupled with tiny machine learning capabilities indeed demonstrate enormous potential for many industries and domains. now, let me share my findings after an experiment with nicla sense me. procedure in my experiment, i decided to play with inair handwriting using an accelerometerbased pen device for handwriting recognition applications in order to test the ability of nicla sense me to identify and process data about handwritten numbers on the edge. compared to handwriting based on touch devices, this task is much more complex and challenging. the device on which the experiment was carried out consisted of a triaxial accelerometer and nicla sense me. the accelerations generated by hand motions were processed on mcu for further inference using the neuton tinyml model. step 1 model training for model training, i created my own dataset by capturing data containing 200 samples for each handwritten digit from 0 to 9. each sample was recorded for 2 seconds with a frequency of 100 hz. its easy to calculate how many times i had to move my hands in the air to collect this data, and its even easier to imagine what my family members were thinking about me x200b training dataset i merge captured samples to a single csv file and add a target variable using python script. the resultant dataset consisted of three features accelerometer axes and 400000 rows 200 samples by 200 rows for each digit. i uploaded the dataset in a csv format to the neuton tinyml platform, selected the target variable digit, target metric accuracy. and then i enabled the tinyml option, selected 8bit calculations without float support. for this case, i activated the digital signal processing option for automatic data preprocessing and feature extraction. the model was trained automatically, and nothing needed to be compressed. x200b x200b the platform allows us to see a preprocessed dataset. it merged 200 samples in one row and added some statistical features min, max, mean, etc. x200b i chose neuton for this experiment since the platform automatically builds models that are optimal in size and accuracy. i also tried to train the same model with tensorflow. heck out the comparison of the resultant metrics x200b just have a look at the dramatic difference in the number of coefficients, neutons model has 42 times fewer coefficients than a tensorflow one! step 2 embedding into a microcontroller after the training was completed, i downloaded the archive containing all the necessary files for the embedding to the microcontrollers firmware project. x200b i uploaded all the components to github so that you can easily replicate my experiment for yourself step 3 running ondevice inferences i connected my device to a pc via usb to display inference results. check out the outcomes of my experiment on the video below x200b as you can see, the sensor accuracy is really high so it managed to identify all the numbers with great probability. the model operates right on the device and weighs about 1 kb. thats what i call real tinyml! conclusion i believe that the future belongs to such incredibly tiny machine learning solutions. the ability to sense and accurately process various types of data in realtime, at low energy consumption but with high computing power opens up new opportunities in many fields. the implementation of such solutions can, for instance, streamline robotic science, ease the detection of seismic activities and dangerous gases in the air, advance iot devices that we use on a daily basis, and a lot more the scenarios are infinite! isnt that inspiring? please write in the comments below what other experiments you want me to do with nicla sense me! || "
arduino,"im writing an article on the top iot platforms in 2022 that have a very low learning curve but support many use cases. for example, arduino cloud has support of his loyal community and a huge set of libraries for everything yet they dont really support business use cases, for example, ota updates to 100s of devices in the field at once its a platform for hobbyists i know. which platforms do you prefer? || thingsboard || i like azure iot hub for large projects that need to be highly scalable. for smaller projects id choose azure iot central. || take a look at focused on nontechnical end users, not developers. simply no learning curve instead of very low"
