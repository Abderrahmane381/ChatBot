embedded systems,"hello everyone, i am graduate student pursuing masters in cyber physical systems concentration in iot i have done a course work like fudamentals of internet of things, connected devices and embedded , ml for iot, mlops with devops when i try to apply for an iot engineer even as an entry level they are asking for 5 years of experience in iot. is there a position for entry level iot engineer ? or its like only experience i can apply for the role ? || iot is a relatively new field that has grown rapidly in recent years, and to expect someone to have 5 years of experience is not a reasonable requirement. we tried and failed at hiring experienced iot engineers, so we typically hire new grads and train them on the job. it sucks that youre seeing this side of the market. those companies who are adamant on hiring iot engineers end up hiring software developers with some exposure to iot, or a pure it person who spun up a server for lora or similar. in any case they end up regretting it. it really comes from a gross misunderstanding of what iot is. || following this || not sure what type of companies youre looking at but coming from someone who started an iot company and ran it for 10 years, i think the biggest issue is that a lot of iot companies may be of the smaller startup size where the stakes are too high to hire entry level since theres no room for messing up something as critical as firmwarehardware. id guess searching for a job in a larger company where theres a larger breadth of experience across a big team with more room for growth and development would be a good option."

embedded systems,"hello folks, im a digital artist trying to change careers to development. i have always been fascinated with cutting edge technology that involves physical products. some examples are the apple vision pro, waymo cars, google glasses etc.. i did some research and apparently these fall under the iot category. and that theres mainly two aspects to it softwareengineering, ux and hardware embedded systems. my question is how and which area should i get started? i would preferably like to avoid a lengthy schooling. my preferred way of getting that first job would be intense self learning and building some projects to show off skills and if absolutely necessary do a 23 year program. regarding my skills and interests. i am a skilled artist who likes to create visually stunning things. i love to create things in general hence why i choose the dev but from experience, i feel like my job is disposable as its not in the product development area in a company which i think is the heart of a company. || the most likely way to get into tech is with a 4year degree in computer science. the next most likely way is with a 4year degree in something close to cs. it is possible for you to get into it other ways, but they are much more difficult. there is no way any of us can tell you if you are good at or would enjoy being a software or hardware engineer. i would suggest something like the harvard class cs50x. that will introduce you to some cs concepts and writing code. at the end of it you should have more developed thoughts on what you might want to do and how well you do at self paced learning. || the current job market is problematic. its not what you know , its who you know or more like who knows you. do you have projects that you can show off ?? when you look for a job, does the employer ask what is a digital artist ?? you will be in competition with people with degrees or are also looking for new jobs that have experience. if you can not define what it is you do or what it is what you want to do, who will listen to you ?? if you have an idea for a product, put it up on a site like you do not have to actually sell it, you just want to show off what you can do. you may even find that your product idea does sell and you do not need to find a regular job. good luck, have fun, learn something new"
embedded systems,"hi, im working on iot embedded system, and currently im not sure which way i should go. im leaning into integrating mff2 into my system, but im worried about longevity 5 years. i will be providing my device to customers around the eu, and my biggest concern is, what to do when mvno that is attached to my mff2 chip suddenly shuts down? is there any way to change mvno remotly or the only option is to change mff2 chip? || good discussion in this older post in short yeah its a big decision committing to purchase something that will last 5, 10 or even 15 years for super long duration devices. i dont think any of them can really guarantee that they wont shut down, or have robust processes in place to solve migration in the event that they do. on one hand you have bigger companies like kore, 1nce, etc that are doing really well businesswise. on the other hand you have smaller companies like miotiq or iot creators that maintain reliability by operating within their profit margin. ultimately the most reliable approach may be to stick to nano sims and be able to switch them in a worst case scenario. || the choice of connectivity provider is extremely important... go for interesting economic choices on paper like 1nce... its an illusion when we know their current economic situation... its a real risk. the only full mvno that has existed for 25 years and is the only one considered a leader at the mno level vodafone orange verizon att, etc. is the english player wireless logic. source gartner the euicc on iot sims with the sgp32.iot standard will also change things in the years to come, not to mention the integration of isims in hardware but to date a real m2m sim supplier has hardened formats even in triple cutting and embeds an euicc bootstrap on its sims || the complete iot ecosystem is not yet ready... there is still a lot of testing or development phase and certain economic issues are slowing down the implementation of this standard... i would say that everything will be mature within 5 years maximum"
embedded systems,"im currently pursuing 3rd year in computer science engineering with specialization in iot and automation whichc means , in contrast to core cse , i learn embedded systems, sensors and actuators, and few more iot related subjects. next semester it will be time for our placements and i have, what i find a difficult choice to make to whether stay true and continue to only go for jobs that involves iot or choose something mainstream. i love working with iot , sensors, robotics, cloud and anything thats related to actual hardware and getting my hands dirty. but my seniors and some friends in the industry often say different things about the potential and growth of iot compared to that of ai , data science , etc. though im not the type to go after money first, im still compelled to take the decision that can give me a bright future. so.. i want to ask those experienced and working here in this sub about what i should look out for and how i should go about it , as , if i go mainstream, as far as i know, quick money more oppurtunities optional post graduation degree , but if i go with iot maybe slow money less opputunities i will have to do a pg degree as soon as possible, which is a bit of a financial burden on my family. please help me make this decision, and i would appreciate if you gave me a an idea of what i should master if i do end up choosing iot as my career. tldr im in my 3rd year of in cse with iot and automation specialization and are unsure whether to pursue a career in iot or opt for mainstream fields like ai or data science. i love working with hardware and iot but am concerned about iots growth and earning potential compared to ai and data science. while im not focused on money, im thinking about future opportunities and the need for a postgraduation degree if i do end up going for iot. || iot and ai will be hand in hand. iot is embedded engineer. youll either work on hardware vlsi stuff or firmware developing device drivers or device services or cloud. all the gathered data then flows through data engineers, data scientists and then ai models are developed. data analytics teams will draw conclusions on top of gathered data. dont overthink it, literally every job is more or less doing the exact same thing out there. only the use cases are different. all the above roles except embedded is domain agnostic. || i recently started an iot company for cellular sensors that property managers use for water leak, humidity, power, and temperature monitoring its absolutely not scaling as easy as software only ai companys but i find working with physical products is extremely rewarding. from a business side hardware is not as easy for competitors to copy, software has never been easier. || i like iot, and the most important thing to me is being part of a good team, my knowledge is known around me and even if by now i cant put my hands on a soldering iron or having the thrill of developing on a limited storage, im happy and when they interview someone for a pure iot opportunity, be sure they asked me first then ask my opinion on the iot skills of candidates. i keep going to iot events and read around to stay updated. even if now i work as full stack developer. maybe ill miss the iot thrill but im making sure to have left the door slightly opened in every company i crossed, and still present myself as an iot developer, who can do front and back but it isnt my specialty."
embedded systems,"so i19, m am a student from south africa. i am currently on my last year of receiving my bachelors in it with my major being in iot and cloud computing. the degree is bachelors in informations and communications and technology in iot. so i am planning on applying to a graduate program next year and in my community there is an amazing global gaming company with a great graduate program. in my country experience is very important. my question is, would be advisable to join the graduate program of a game dev company in the it field although my degree is more on the cloud, internet etc. any advice would be really really appreciated. edit from what ive seen there isnt any graduate programs related to embedded systems and obviously everything is very competitive. || iot has nothing to do with gaming. sounds like it is more of a personal decision on which direction to go. starting to get realworld experience is worth more than a graduate program imo. find a large manufacturing, automation or processing company needing that type of it help and start building your resume experience. good luck || the degree you mentioned is correctly structured emphasizing iot with cloud skills. i hope this is also including messaging systems, gateways, and some overview of industrial automation concepts. i have not seen gaming architecture. you can compare both and decide accordingly where your interest lies. || well man, id say your still young anything to give you experience is good, be it its a graduate program or in field experience, as long as you soak up everything in which ever option you choose. once you get a hang on things then you can decide on the best option. being in south africa probably taking whatever opportunity that is there will be great for you, options are rare."
embedded systems,"i am preparing a demo and instructions on how to integrate firmware execution history into embedded systems with iot functionality for diagnostic purposes using the the data is initially logged in binary format to circular buffer in ram to ensure maximum logging speed and minimize data size in memory maximize history. this binary data must be transferred to the server host and saved into a binary file for decoding. the size of the circular buffer in ram typically ranges from a few kb to a few hundred kb. i am seeking advice on the most suitable methods for transferring this data to a server, from where it could then be downloaded to a pc for decoding, processing, and analysis. using the mqtt protocol, the data must be split into smaller chunks and encoded in hex or base64 format. are there other methods, such as direct binary data transfer, with the following characteristics? minimal ram usage, as ram is quite limited in most embedded systems both stack and working buffers. data should be sent in several smaller pieces so that smaller communication buffer can be used if there is a larger circular buffer in the project. minimal data overhead for transfer to the server minimizing cost of data. avoidance of complex communication libraries that would require significant program memory or steep learning curve. is there any online documentation or a project e.g., on github that demonstrates how to implement this most efficiently and with minimal ram and program memory usage? thanks in advance for your suggestions. || using the mqtt protocol, the data must be split into smaller chunks and encoded in hex or base64 format. are you saying that you must use mqtt to transfer the data from the device to the server? why? also, why does the binary data need to be encoded? mqtt supports binary payloads. || as the maker of the walter multiradio iot module ltem, nbiot, wifi, ble, gnss i would strongly advise to take a look at coap dtls. by switching over to a udp based protocol you loose the tcp overhead, coap adds the reliability again. if security is not that important you can also use plain coap or even raw udp but then you would need to implement some reliability by yourself. || you could use tcp or mqtt. whats up with hex and b64. wouldnt it add another step to consume your resources? you can use file system on the server to push the files. divide files into chunks. serially store and number them. this will prevent corrupting the data in case something goes wrong and other chunks would be fine. for pc, you can write script to stitch this data and convert it for further processing."
embedded systems,"hi everyone, i have a degree in electronics systems, and recently, i started working in video surveillance systems. my current role involves working with cctv cameras, networking, configuration, and video management software. now, im planning to pursue an engineering degree in iot cloud. i chose this degree because i want to work and study simultaneously to afford the tuition. heres my question 1. would my current work experience in video surveillance systems cctv, networking, software configuration, etc. be beneficial in the iot and embedded systems world? 2. can i build a bridge between these two fields, or are they too unrelated, meaning id essentially be starting from scratch even after getting the degree? thanks in advance for your advice and insights! || as someone who has worked in video security and iot the simple answer is...yes of course! they are converging and especially now that 5g6g are capable of higher data rates within iot modules and rate plans. today any streaming is maxed out in the us at 720i to 1080p quality depending on your rate plan and usage. as networks expand that will allow for 4k, but in the short term the ability to upload video events triggered by video is common ex hunting video camera systems that have 5m units sold over the past few years using cat.m1 to upload photosvideo. i am working on converged modem systems for the video world...will be a fun 2nd half of 2025. || well, i personally have been working on iot devices with cameras that stream feed to cloud, then get frames process with ai models then based on outcome, i can make the camera circuit do something. i can also control other iot device like robots based on camera feeds. it really depends on how you connect the dots. fiy, i am litearlly talking about esp32cam || cctv cameras have a long tradition of being analog signals, ntscpal. so depending on weather you have an analog or digital camera will determine what all needs to be done. lol, listen to this kid, starting from scratch. before digital camera there were analog camera. starting in the 1950s. there is nothing a beginner can ask that has not already been done many many times over"
